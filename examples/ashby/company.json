We’re looking for an ambitious full-stack engineer who is laser-focused on solving customer problems and making the right long-term investments to solve them not only today but in our future features and products.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">What Ashby gives you in return is the best of both early and growth-stage environments. The agency and no-nonsense of a seed startup: you write product specs, make product and design decisions, and build in an almost-no-meeting culture. While also the product-market fit and scale of a growth-stage startup: tens of thousands of daily users who depend on your software and eagerly await your next feature.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We have notable customers like Notion, Linear, Shopify, and Snowflake. Our growth and retention metrics are best-in-class among our peers: we have tens of millions in ARR, growing &gt;100% year over year, very low churn, and many years of runway. We’ll share more details once we meet.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You’ve probably seen this role posted before, and it’s because we’re always expanding the team (we’re on track to double this year). We’re bubbling with ideas on how to support Talent Acquisition through software, and we’ve started the journey of building products beyond Talent Acquisition. We read every application and aim to respond to yours within 3-4 days (often sooner).</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1>About the Role and How We Work</h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Our engineering culture strives to recreate the environments where we did our best work as ICs – where we had the ownership and agency to impact our users with creative and innovative software.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">I started my career building software for artists in the Visual Effects industry. It was a formative experience for me as a software engineer because success relied on my ability to be a product manager and designer. I talked to artists to understand their needs. I came up with ideas. I did industry research, designed interfaces, and prototyped ideas. I watched artists use what I built and decided what to tackle in the next iteration. No daily stand-ups, no t-shirt sizing, no planning meetings.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">I studied computer science to solve problems, not tickets, and this felt exactly like that. I not only felt creative and fulfilled but the agency and ownership we were given as engineers powered an incredible amount of innovation.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Innovation came differently (or not at all) at technology startups beyond the seed stage, often through an engineer’s force of will and ability to push back against culture (rather than any encouragement from it). Engineering was narrowed to implementation and delivery, partly due to the influence of other departments and partly due to the influx of \"Agile\" processes like sprint planning. In those companies, I felt like a JIRA jockey. </p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">At Ashby, we’re building an environment that is optimistic about what engineers can own and achieve. An environment that embraces innovative engineers, and, frankly, often stays out of their way. As a Product Engineer, you’ll take ownership over a large portion of one of our products and own projects end-to-end (wearing hats traditionally worn by product and design). You’ll research competitors, write product specs, make wireframes, and more. To ground it with examples, product engineers at Ashby have:</p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Designed and built automated interview scheduling. This feature automates scheduling by calculating possible times from a pool of interviewers and other constraints, and then presenting these times to the candidate for selection via our responsive web app. This solves the “Calendar Tetris” problem I talk about in \"What We're Building.\"</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Built a generalized declarative filter architecture that allows users to create complex filters for any record with a consistent UI and compile it to SQL in our backend. Many user-facing features use it.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Specced, designed, and implemented a feature that allows users to complete signing offers entirely within Ashby. This project involved talking to customers to understand their requirements, deciding what technologies to use, building a prototype, and working with other team members to integrate the final implementation into additional features.</p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1>What We’re Building</h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">As engineers, we are used to tooling that makes us <strong>better</strong> at what we do. When we started Ashby, we saw the opposite with Talent Acquisition software. Recruiting teams were leveling up how they did their work, but instead of software meeting this new standard, it held them back.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Scheduling a final round is an excellent example. Recruiting teams wanted to schedule candidates faster, track interviewer preparation and quality, and do it with half the headcount. A recruiter needed to manually collect availability from the candidate, identify qualified interviewers, perform “Calendar Tetris” to find who is available to interview the candidate, schedule on the earliest date possible, and make any last-minute adjustments as availability changed. They must do this while considering the interview load on each individual and whether interviewers need to be trained and shadowing others. 🥵 TA software didn’t help.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">As hiring managers, we know TA is a critical function, and as engineers, we know software can do better. So, we built and continue to build Ashby to give TA teams the <em>highest</em> standard of tooling. Software that’s intelligent and powerful. Software that provides insights into where they’re failing and automates or simplifies many of the tasks they’re underwater with. We want other functions and departments to be jealous of what TA teams can do with Ashby, and today they often are!</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1>Why You Should or Shouldn’t Apply</h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Software engineers come in many flavors, not all of which fit our model. Here are some things  to help you decide if this fits you and what you’re looking for:</p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You’re not afraid to tackle any part of a technology stack.</em> You do what’s necessary to successfully deliver a feature, whether writing frontend or choosing new infrastructure. We’ll provide a supportive environment to do it successfully (e.g., design system, SRE team).</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You’ve tackled projects with a lot of product and technical ambiguity, and you thrive at the intersection of the two. </em>We’re not building a simple CRUD app, and many of the challenges we tackle require you to use your knowledge of our customers to build powerful abstractions and flexibility in the system to solve a class of problems.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You know how to strike the right balance between speed and quality. </em>Ashby wasn’t built quickly. We took four years to launch publicly because convincing customers to switch required a high-quality product. However, time isn’t infinite, especially for a startup, so we still move with urgency—we’ve built the equivalent of three or more VC-backed startups with a very small team.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You are ambitious and always looking to improve your skills. </em>For most engineers, this role will give you more freedom and responsibilities than you’ve experienced in the past. To thrive (and level up), you’ll need to be open to feedback (and we give lots of it).</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You’re an excellent collaborator and communicator. </em>Ownership and freedom don’t mean you work in a vacuum. You’ll need to vet your decisions with the appropriate stakeholders, keep them up to date when necessary, and work with other engineers to get your projects across the finish line. Clear and concise communication helps a lot here!</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You seek to create leverage in your work. </em>The nature of software is that you can often automate or abstract what would be tedious, time-consuming work. Your impatience usually leads to new abstractions, tools to allow Support to debug before Engineering, new lint rules to prevent common bugs, etc. </p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><strong>Put another way, you shouldn’t apply if:</strong></p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You need company-driven process and structure to get your projects across the finish line. </em>Sprint planning and well-defined project management processes are things you need or look to others to lead. You’d rather focus on the technical details and challenges.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You only want to do exciting work. </em>We’re building a team of kind, collaborative folks. Customer issues and investigations are distributed across the team, including our high-level ICs.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You can get lost in the details.</em> Once you start implementation, it can be hard to take a step back and think about the project as a whole. You like everything to be planned upfront.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You haven’t led or taken ownership of projects before.</em> You’re used to working with tech leads and taking on tasks distributed by them.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You want to mentor earlier-career engineers.</em> We rely on engineers owning their projects, so we need engineers with that experience. This requires the team to be reasonably tenured. More than 90% of the team would be considered Senior or above in the industry today, so mentorship opportunities are very limited.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>To you, a tech lead, staff, or principal engineer is someone who spends most of their time project managing or doing architecture reviews. </em>Our most tenured engineers spend most of their time building, and we often trust them with our most challenging problems. While they lead product and technical areas and help other engineers plan their most challenging work, it’s not a requirement, nor do engineers need their sign-off.</p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1>Engineering Culture</h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Our engineering culture is motivated by Benji’s (my Co-founder and CEO) and my belief that a small, talented team, given the right environment, can build high-quality software fast (and work regular hours!). We do it through:</p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Minimal process with ownership over decisions normally made by product and design</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Natural collaboration and deliberate communication</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Investing in tools and abstractions that give us leverage</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Putting effort into building a diverse team</p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h2><strong>Minimal Process &amp; Lots of Ownership</strong></h2><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">The best engineers we’ve worked with delivered reliably magical outcomes. They took customer problems and relentlessly drove them to solutions that were not only successful but often brilliant and creative. While they did this with minimal oversight, stakeholders were never in the dark as to what was going on, and no setback was a surprise.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Traditional product-development processes aren’t meant for the best engineers. Their purpose is to create consistent outcomes regardless of the engineer’s skill. But, consistency comes at the expense of an engineer’s time and freedom—both ingredients necessary to generate those magical outcomes. As a result, process stifles the best engineers and doesn’t give others the opportunity to practice the behaviors that made the best engineers the “best.”</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">At Ashby, we want to build an environment that encourages every engineer to be their best. So, at Ashby, every Engineer runs their project. Product Managers (and Designers) build strategy, do customer research, and hand off problem briefs to Engineers. Engineers take on the rest: they research the problem, write product specs, build wireframes, and implement their solution end-to-end. We rely on engineers, not process, to push information outward to the relevant folks (e.g., Product Managers) and pull folks in to help (e.g., Designers, Infra). It’s a new level of ownership for many engineers, but we’d rather an engineer fail a bit and coach up their skills than use process as a crutch. Not everyone succeeds in our culture, but those who do <em>thrive</em>.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h2><strong>Collaboration is Natural &amp; Communication is Deliberate</strong></h2><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Our engineering team consists of lifelong learners who are talented but also humble and kind (meet them <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://www.ashbyhq.com/team\"><u>here</u></a>!). These attributes create an environment where collaboration happens naturally. We combine this with research, prototyping, and written proposals to see around corners and get feedback from the team across time zones. Focus time is something that we hold sacred, and, with thoughtful and deliberate communication, engineers are in &lt;2h meetings per week (I wrote about it <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://www.ashbyhq.com/blog/company/thoughtful-communication\"><u>here</u></a>).</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">To drive it home, here's a recent calendar of an engineer who has been with us for over 4 years:</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><div style=\"text-align:left\"><img style=\"max-width:100%\" src=\"https://app.ashbyhq.com/api/images/user-content/4ea5f68e-c33e-4ac9-831a-e732bee4a303/d4679311-9dba-4031-bf5e-19ce78597ab1/calendar.png\" /></div><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We also meet in person at least twice a year, once as a department and once as a company. You also have a small budget to meet up with folks in your city/region.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h2><strong>Increase Leverage, not Team Size</strong></h2><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We built Ashby with the quality, breadth, and depth that many customers would expect from much larger teams over larger time scales. We’ve done this through investment in:</p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><strong>Great developer tooling.</strong> Our CI/CD takes ~10m, and we deploy at least 15x a day. A debugger that works out of the box. Everyone on the team has contributed to our developer experience 💪🏾.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><strong>Building blocks to create powerful and customizable products fast.</strong> At the core of Ashby is a set of common components (analytics modeling and query language, policy engine, workflow engine, design system) that we constantly improve. Each improvement to a common component cascades throughout our app (short video below).</p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Here’s an impromptu quote from Arjun in our company Slack of what it’s like to build a feature at Ashby:</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><div style=\"text-align:left\"><img style=\"max-width:100%\" src=\"https://app.ashbyhq.com/api/images/user-content/4ea5f68e-c33e-4ac9-831a-e732bee4a303/8d94727a-46d8-42a2-9627-ddcd7f822f95/arjun.png\" /></div><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">And a demo of one of these building blocks:</p><div><div style=\"left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:62.5%\"><iframe src=\"https://embedded-media.ashbyhq.com/embed/4ea5f68e-c33e-4ac9-831a-e732bee4a303/9a5f032d-c731-411e-98cf-261517156f01\" style=\"top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0\" allowfullscreen scrolling=\"no\" allow=\"encrypted-media *; picture-in-picture *;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-presentation\"></iframe></div></div><h2><strong>Put Effort into Diversity</strong></h2><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Diverse teams drive innovation and better outcomes. Having seen my mother and partner build their careers as minority women in non-diverse fields, I want to make sure Ashby creates opportunities for the next generation of engineers from underrepresented groups.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Today, 21% of engineers at Ashby are from underrepresented groups. It’s not great, and we are taking conscious steps to improve, like sourcing diverse candidates, providing generous paid family leave, no leetcode interviews, and more.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1><strong>Interview Process</strong></h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">At Ashby, our team and interview process want to help you show your best self. We’ll dive into past projects and simulate working together via pair programming, writing product and tech specs collaboratively, and talking through decisions. There are no leetcode or whiteboard exercises.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Our interview process is three rounds:</p><ol style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Introduction call with Hiring Manager (15 to 30m, live)</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">A technical screen where we pair in our actual codebase (1h, live)</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Three non-coding interviews that focus on product thinking, technical design, and infrastructure (3h 15m, live can be split across multiple days)</p></li></ol><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Depending on our leadership team’s bandwidth, we may start with an <em>additional</em> 30m screen with a recruiter.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Your hiring manager will be your main point of contact and prep you for interviews. Each round will have written guidance so you know what to expect (you’ll need minimal preparation). You’ll meet 4 to 6 people in engineering (with 5-15 minutes in each interview to ask them questions). If we don’t give an offer, we’ll provide feedback!</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1><strong>Your First Three Months at Ashby</strong></h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We want an exceptional onboarding experience for every new hire. At Ashby, your dev environment is set up with a single script, you push your first product change on day one, and you spend the rest of your time shipping product changes that give you a tour of our codebase and best practices. The product changes increase in scope and ambiguity from simple copy changes to the delivery of a prominent, impactful feature. Your manager will do a 30, 60, and 90-day review to give feedback and calibrate on how we work together.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">It’s a team effort to get you successfully onboarded; you’ll have a peer paired with you to answer questions, pair program, and check in often to see if you need help. The rest of the team will run training sessions on our culture, product, engineering process, and technical architecture.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1><strong>Technology Stack</strong></h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">I’m sharing our tech stack with the caveat that we don’t require previous experience in it (but a love of typed languages is helpful 😀): TypeScript (frontend &amp; backend), React, GraphQL API, Node.js, Postgres, Redis.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">When they joined Ashby, many of our engineers switched from other languages like Swift and Kotlin (<a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://linkedin.com/in/benasher44/\"><u>Ben</u></a>), platforms like iOS (<a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/tom-quist-0925a199/\"><u>Tom</u></a>) and Windows (<a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/sergeygalich/\"><u>Sergey</u></a>). We care more about fundamentals (e.g., debugging, abstractions) and how fast you learn. For folks on the team who switched, it's nice seeing changes hot reload versus waiting for XCode to compile 😅.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1><strong>Benefits</strong></h1><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Competitive salary and equity.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">10-year exercise window for stock options. You shouldn’t feel pressure to purchase stock options if you leave Ashby —do it when you feel financially comfortable.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Unlimited PTO, and we will encourage you to take it.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">A minimum of 12 weeks of fully paid parental leave, covered by Ashby. For folks outside the US, it may be longer to be in line with regional requirements.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Generous equipment, software, and office furniture budget. Get what you need to be happy and productive!</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">$100/month education budget with more expensive items (like conferences) covered with manager approval.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">If you’re in the US, we offer top-tier health insurance for you and your dependents, with 100% of premiums covered by Ashby. In other countries, we provide high-quality supplemental health insurance for you and your dependents, also fully covered by us.</p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Ashby’s success hinges on hiring great people and creating an environment where we can be happy, feel challenged, and do our best work. We’re being deliberate about building that environment from the ground up. I hope that excites you enough to apply.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>Ashby provides equal employment opportunities (EEO) to all employees and applicants for employment without regard to race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability, genetics, sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression.

You do what’s necessary to successfully deliver a feature, whether writing frontend or choosing new infrastructure. We’ll provide a supportive environment to do it successfully (e.g., design system, SRE team).\n\n - You’ve tackled projects with a lot of product and technical ambiguity, and you thrive at the intersection of the two.

Your impatience usually leads to new abstractions, tools to allow Support to debug before Engineering, new lint rules to prevent common bugs, etc.\n\nPut another way, you shouldn’t apply if:\n\n - You need company-driven process and structure to get your projects across the finish line. Sprint planning and well-defined project management processes are things you need or look to others to lead. You’d rather focus on the technical details and challenges.\n\n - You only want to do exciting work. We’re building a team of kind, collaborative folks. Customer issues and investigations are distributed across the team, including our high-level ICs.\n\n - You can get lost in the details. Once you start implementation, it can be hard to take a step back and think about the project as a whole. You like everything to be planned upfront.\n\n - You haven’t led or taken ownership of projects before. You’re used to working with tech leads and taking on tasks distributed by them.\n\n - You want to mentor earlier-career engineers. We rely on engineers owning their projects, so we need engineers with that experience. This requires the team to be reasonably tenured. More than 90% of the team would be considered Senior or above in the industry today, so mentorship opportunities are very limited.\n\n - To you, a tech lead, staff, or principal engineer is someone who spends most of their time project managing or doing architecture reviews. Our most tenured engineers spend most of their time building, and we often trust them with our most challenging problems. While they lead product and technical areas and help other engineers plan their most challenging work, it’s not a requirement, nor do engineers need their sign-off.\n\n\nENGINEERING CULTURE\n\nOur engineering culture is motivated by Benji’s (my Co-founder and CEO) and my belief that a small, talented team, given the right environment, can build high-quality software fast (and work regular hours!). We do it through:\n\n - Minimal process with ownership over decisions normally made by product and design\n\n - Natural collaboration and deliberate communication\n\n - Investing in tools and abstractions that give us leverage\n\n - Putting effort into building a diverse team\n\n\nMINIMAL PROCESS & LOTS OF OWNERSHIP\n\nThe best engineers we’ve worked with delivered reliably magical outcomes. They took customer problems and relentlessly drove them to solutions that were not only successful but often brilliant and creative. While they did this with minimal oversight, stakeholders were never in the dark as to what was going on, and no setback was a surprise.\n\nTraditional product-development processes aren’t meant for the best engineers. Their purpose is to create consistent outcomes regardless of the engineer’s skill. But, consistency comes at the expense of an engineer’s time and freedom—both ingredients necessary to generate those magical outcomes. As a result, process stifles the best engineers and doesn’t give others the opportunity to practice the behaviors that made the best engineers the “best.”\n\nAt Ashby, we want to build an environment that encourages every engineer to be their best. So, at Ashby, every Engineer runs their project. Product Managers (and Designers) build strategy, do customer research, and hand off problem briefs to Engineers. Engineers take on the rest: they research the problem, write product specs, build wireframes, and implement their solution end-to-end. We rely on engineers, not process, to push information outward to the relevant folks (e.g., Product Managers) and pull folks in to help (e.g., Designers, Infra). It’s a new level of ownership for many engineers, but we’d rather an engineer fail a bit and coach up their skills than use process as a crutch. Not everyone succeeds in our culture, but those who do thrive.\n\n\nCOLLABORATION IS NATURAL & COMMUNICATION IS DELIBERATE\n\nOur engineering team consists of lifelong learners who are talented but also humble and kind (meet them here https://www.ashbyhq.com/team!). These attributes create an environment where collaboration happens naturally. We combine this with research, prototyping, and written proposals to see around corners and get feedback from the team across time zones. Focus time is something that we hold sacred, and, with thoughtful and deliberate communication, engineers are in <2h meetings per week (I wrote about it here https://www.ashbyhq.com/blog/company/thoughtful-communication).\n\nTo drive it home, here's a recent calendar of an engineer who has been with us for over 4 years:\n\n[https://app.ashbyhq.com/api/images/user-content/4ea5f68e-c33e-4ac9-831a-e732bee4a303/d4679311-9dba-4031-bf5e-19ce78597ab1/calendar.png]\n\nWe also meet in person at least twice a year, once as a department and once as a company. You also have a small budget to meet up with folks in your city/region.\n\n\nINCREASE LEVERAGE, NOT TEAM SIZE\n\nWe built Ashby with the quality, breadth, and depth that many customers would expect from much larger teams over larger time scales. We’ve done this through investment in:\n\n - Great developer tooling. Our CI/CD takes ~10m, and we deploy at least 15x a day. A debugger that works out of the box. Everyone on the team has contributed to our developer experience 💪🏾.\n\n - Building blocks to create powerful and customizable products fast. At the core of Ashby is a set of common components (analytics modeling and query language, policy engine, workflow engine, design system) that we constantly improve. Each improvement to a common component cascades throughout our app (short video below).\n\nHere’s an impromptu quote from Arjun in our company Slack of what it’s like to build a feature at Ashby:\n\n[https://app.ashbyhq.com/api/images/user-content/4ea5f68e-c33e-4ac9-831a-e732bee4a303/8d94727a-46d8-42a2-9627-ddcd7f822f95/arjun.png]\n\nAnd a demo of one of these building blocks:\n\n\nPUT EFFORT INTO DIVERSITY\n\nDiverse teams drive innovation and better outcomes. Having seen my mother and partner build their careers as minority women in non-diverse fields, I want to make sure Ashby creates opportunities for the next generation of engineers from underrepresented groups.\n\nToday, 21% of engineers at Ashby are from underrepresented groups. It’s not great, and we are taking conscious steps to improve, like sourcing diverse candidates, providing generous paid family leave, no leetcode interviews, and more.\n\n\nINTERVIEW PROCESS\n\nAt Ashby, our team and interview process want to help you show your best self. We’ll dive into past projects and simulate working together via pair programming, writing product and tech specs collaboratively, and talking through decisions. There are no leetcode or whiteboard exercises.\n\nOur interview process is three rounds:\n\n 1. Introduction call with Hiring Manager (15 to 30m, live)\n\n 2. A technical screen where we pair in our actual codebase (1h, live)\n\n 3. Three non-coding interviews that focus on product thinking, technical design, and infrastructure (3h 15m, live can be split across multiple days)\n\nDepending on our leadership team’s bandwidth, we may start with an additional 30m screen with a recruiter.\n\nYour hiring manager will be your main point of contact and prep you for interviews. Each round will have written guidance so you know what to expect (you’ll need minimal preparation). You’ll meet 4 to 6 people in engineering (with 5-15 minutes in each interview to ask them questions). If we don’t give an offer, we’ll provide feedback!\n\n\nYOUR FIRST THREE MONTHS AT ASHBY\n\nWe want an exceptional onboarding experience for every new hire. At Ashby, your dev environment is set up with a single script, you push your first product change on day one, and you spend the rest of your time shipping product changes that give you a tour of our codebase and best practices. The product changes increase in scope and ambiguity from simple copy changes to the delivery of a prominent, impactful feature. Your manager will do a 30, 60, and 90-day review to give feedback and calibrate on how we work together.\n\nIt’s a team effort to get you successfully onboarded; you’ll have a peer paired with you to answer questions, pair program, and check in often to see if you need help. The rest of the team will run training sessions on our culture, product, engineering process, and technical architecture.\n\n\nTECHNOLOGY STACK\n\nI’m sharing our tech stack with the caveat that we don’t require previous experience in it (but a love of typed languages is helpful 😀): TypeScript (frontend & backend), React, GraphQL API, Node.js, Postgres, Redis.\n\nWhen they joined Ashby, many of our engineers switched from other languages like Swift and Kotlin (Ben https://linkedin.com/in/benasher44/), platforms like iOS (Tom https://www.linkedin.com/in/tom-quist-0925a199/) and Windows (Sergey https://www.linkedin.com/in/sergeygalich/). We care more about fundamentals (e.g., debugging, abstractions) and how fast you learn. For folks on the team who switched, it's nice seeing changes hot reload versus waiting for XCode to compile 😅.\n\n\nBENEFITS\n\n - Competitive salary and equity.\n\n - 10-year exercise window for stock options. You shouldn’t feel pressure to purchase stock options if you leave Ashby —do it when you feel financially comfortable.\n\n - Unlimited PTO, and we will encourage you to take it.\n\n - A minimum of 12 weeks of fully paid parental leave, covered by Ashby. For folks outside the US, it may be longer to be in line with regional requirements.\n\n - Generous equipment, software, and office furniture budget. Get what you need to be happy and productive!\n\n - $100/month education budget with more expensive items (like conferences) covered with manager approval.\n\n - If you’re in the US, we offer top-tier health insurance for you and your dependents, with 100% of premiums covered by Ashby. In other countries, we provide high-quality supplemental health insurance for you and your dependents, also fully covered by us.\n\nAshby’s success hinges on hiring great people and creating an environment where we can be happy, feel challenged, and do our best work. We’re being deliberate about building that environment from the ground up. I hope that excites you enough to apply.\n\nAshby provides equal employment opportunities (EEO) to all employees and applicants for employment without regard to race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability, genetics, sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression.

            "descriptionHtml": "<p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Hi 👋🏾 I’m <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/abhikpramanik\"><u>Abhik</u></a>, Ashby's Co-Founder and VP of Engineering. We’re looking for an ambitious full-stack engineer who is laser-focused on solving customer problems and making the right long-term investments to solve them not only today but in our future features and products.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">What Ashby gives you in return is the best of both early and growth-stage environments. The agency and no-nonsense of a seed startup: you write product specs, make product and design decisions, and build in an almost-no-meeting culture. While also the product-market fit and scale of a growth-stage startup: tens of thousands of daily users who depend on your software and eagerly await your next feature.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We have notable customers like Notion, Linear, Shopify, and Snowflake. Our growth and retention metrics are best-in-class among our peers: we have tens of millions in ARR, growing &gt;100% year over year, very low churn, and many years of runway. We’ll share more details once we meet.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You’ve probably seen this role posted before, and it’s because we’re always expanding the team (we’re on track to double this year). We’re bubbling with ideas on how to support Talent Acquisition through software, and we’ve started the journey of building products beyond Talent Acquisition. We read every application and aim to respond to yours within 3-4 days (often sooner).</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1>About the Role and How We Work</h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Our engineering culture strives to recreate the environments where we did our best work as ICs – where we had the ownership and agency to impact our users with creative and innovative software.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">I started my career building software for artists in the Visual Effects industry. It was a formative experience for me as a software engineer because success relied on my ability to be a product manager and designer. I talked to artists to understand their needs. I came up with ideas. I did industry research, designed interfaces, and prototyped ideas. I watched artists use what I built and decided what to tackle in the next iteration. No daily stand-ups, no t-shirt sizing, no planning meetings.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">I studied computer science to solve problems, not tickets, and this felt exactly like that. I not only felt creative and fulfilled but the agency and ownership we were given as engineers powered an incredible amount of innovation.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Innovation came differently (or not at all) at technology startups beyond the seed stage, often through an engineer’s force of will and ability to push back against culture (rather than any encouragement from it). Engineering was narrowed to implementation and delivery, partly due to the influence of other departments and partly due to the influx of \"Agile\" processes like sprint planning. In those companies, I felt like a JIRA jockey. </p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">At Ashby, we’re building an environment that is optimistic about what engineers can own and achieve. An environment that embraces innovative engineers, and, frankly, often stays out of their way. As a Product Engineer, you’ll take ownership over a large portion of one of our products and own projects end-to-end (wearing hats traditionally worn by product and design). You’ll research competitors, write product specs, make wireframes, and more. To ground it with examples, product engineers at Ashby have:</p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Designed and built automated interview scheduling. This feature automates scheduling by calculating possible times from a pool of interviewers and other constraints, and then presenting these times to the candidate for selection via our responsive web app. This solves the “Calendar Tetris” problem I talk about in \"What We're Building.\"</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Built a generalized declarative filter architecture that allows users to create complex filters for any record with a consistent UI and compile it to SQL in our backend. Many user-facing features use it.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Specced, designed, and implemented a feature that allows users to complete signing offers entirely within Ashby. This project involved talking to customers to understand their requirements, deciding what technologies to use, building a prototype, and working with other team members to integrate the final implementation into additional features.</p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1>What We’re Building</h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">As engineers, we are used to tooling that makes us <strong>better</strong> at what we do. When we started Ashby, we saw the opposite with Talent Acquisition software. Recruiting teams were leveling up how they did their work, but instead of software meeting this new standard, it held them back.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Scheduling a final round is an excellent example. Recruiting teams wanted to schedule candidates faster, track interviewer preparation and quality, and do it with half the headcount. A recruiter needed to manually collect availability from the candidate, identify qualified interviewers, perform “Calendar Tetris” to find who is available to interview the candidate, schedule on the earliest date possible, and make any last-minute adjustments as availability changed. They must do this while considering the interview load on each individual and whether interviewers need to be trained and shadowing others. 🥵 TA software didn’t help.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">As hiring managers, we know TA is a critical function, and as engineers, we know software can do better. So, we built and continue to build Ashby to give TA teams the <em>highest</em> standard of tooling. Software that’s intelligent and powerful. Software that provides insights into where they’re failing and automates or simplifies many of the tasks they’re underwater with. We want other functions and departments to be jealous of what TA teams can do with Ashby, and today they often are!</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1>Why You Should or Shouldn’t Apply</h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Software engineers come in many flavors, not all of which fit our model. Here are some things  to help you decide if this fits you and what you’re looking for:</p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You’re not afraid to tackle any part of a technology stack.</em> You do what’s necessary to successfully deliver a feature, whether writing frontend or choosing new infrastructure. We’ll provide a supportive environment to do it successfully (e.g., design system, SRE team).</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You’ve tackled projects with a lot of product and technical ambiguity, and you thrive at the intersection of the two. </em>We’re not building a simple CRUD app, and many of the challenges we tackle require you to use your knowledge of our customers to build powerful abstractions and flexibility in the system to solve a class of problems.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You know how to strike the right balance between speed and quality. </em>Ashby wasn’t built quickly. We took four years to launch publicly because convincing customers to switch required a high-quality product. However, time isn’t infinite, especially for a startup, so we still move with urgency—we’ve built the equivalent of three or more VC-backed startups with a very small team.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You are ambitious and always looking to improve your skills. </em>For most engineers, this role will give you more freedom and responsibilities than you’ve experienced in the past. To thrive (and level up), you’ll need to be open to feedback (and we give lots of it).</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You’re an excellent collaborator and communicator. </em>Ownership and freedom don’t mean you work in a vacuum. You’ll need to vet your decisions with the appropriate stakeholders, keep them up to date when necessary, and work with other engineers to get your projects across the finish line. Clear and concise communication helps a lot here!</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You seek to create leverage in your work. </em>The nature of software is that you can often automate or abstract what would be tedious, time-consuming work. Your impatience usually leads to new abstractions, tools to allow Support to debug before Engineering, new lint rules to prevent common bugs, etc. </p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><strong>Put another way, you shouldn’t apply if:</strong></p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You need company-driven process and structure to get your projects across the finish line. </em>Sprint planning and well-defined project management processes are things you need or look to others to lead. You’d rather focus on the technical details and challenges.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You only want to do exciting work. </em>We’re building a team of kind, collaborative folks. Customer issues and investigations are distributed across the team, including our high-level ICs.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You can get lost in the details.</em> Once you start implementation, it can be hard to take a step back and think about the project as a whole. You like everything to be planned upfront.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You haven’t led or taken ownership of projects before.</em> You’re used to working with tech leads and taking on tasks distributed by them.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You want to mentor earlier-career engineers.</em> We rely on engineers owning their projects, so we need engineers with that experience. This requires the team to be reasonably tenured. More than 90% of the team would be considered Senior or above in the industry today, so mentorship opportunities are very limited.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>To you, a tech lead, staff, or principal engineer is someone who spends most of their time project managing or doing architecture reviews. </em>Our most tenured engineers spend most of their time building, and we often trust them with our most challenging problems. While they lead product and technical areas and help other engineers plan their most challenging work, it’s not a requirement, nor do engineers need their sign-off.</p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1>Engineering Culture</h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Our engineering culture is motivated by Benji’s (my Co-founder and CEO) and my belief that a small, talented team, given the right environment, can build high-quality software fast (and work regular hours!). We do it through:</p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Minimal process with ownership over decisions normally made by product and design</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Natural collaboration and deliberate communication</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Investing in tools and abstractions that give us leverage</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Putting effort into building a diverse team</p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h2><strong>Minimal Process &amp; Lots of Ownership</strong></h2><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">The best engineers we’ve worked with delivered reliably magical outcomes. They took customer problems and relentlessly drove them to solutions that were not only successful but often brilliant and creative. While they did this with minimal oversight, stakeholders were never in the dark as to what was going on, and no setback was a surprise.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Traditional product-development processes aren’t meant for the best engineers. Their purpose is to create consistent outcomes regardless of the engineer’s skill. But, consistency comes at the expense of an engineer’s time and freedom—both ingredients necessary to generate those magical outcomes. As a result, process stifles the best engineers and doesn’t give others the opportunity to practice the behaviors that made the best engineers the “best.”</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">At Ashby, we want to build an environment that encourages every engineer to be their best. So, at Ashby, every Engineer runs their project. Product Managers (and Designers) build strategy, do customer research, and hand off problem briefs to Engineers. Engineers take on the rest: they research the problem, write product specs, build wireframes, and implement their solution end-to-end. We rely on engineers, not process, to push information outward to the relevant folks (e.g., Product Managers) and pull folks in to help (e.g., Designers, Infra). It’s a new level of ownership for many engineers, but we’d rather an engineer fail a bit and coach up their skills than use process as a crutch. Not everyone succeeds in our culture, but those who do <em>thrive</em>.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h2><strong>Collaboration is Natural &amp; Communication is Deliberate</strong></h2><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Our engineering team consists of lifelong learners who are talented but also humble and kind (meet them <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://www.ashbyhq.com/team\"><u>here</u></a>!). These attributes create an environment where collaboration happens naturally. We combine this with research, prototyping, and written proposals to see around corners and get feedback from the team across time zones. Focus time is something that we hold sacred, and, with thoughtful and deliberate communication, engineers are in &lt;2h meetings per week (I wrote about it <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://www.ashbyhq.com/blog/company/thoughtful-communication\"><u>here</u></a>).</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">To drive it home, here's a recent calendar of an engineer who has been with us for over 4 years:</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><div style=\"text-align:left\"><img style=\"max-width:100%\" src=\"https://app.ashbyhq.com/api/images/user-content/4ea5f68e-c33e-4ac9-831a-e732bee4a303/d4679311-9dba-4031-bf5e-19ce78597ab1/calendar.png\" /></div><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We also meet in person at least twice a year, once as a department and once as a company. You also have a small budget to meet up with folks in your city/region.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h2><strong>Increase Leverage, not Team Size</strong></h2><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We built Ashby with the quality, breadth, and depth that many customers would expect from much larger teams over larger time scales. We’ve done this through investment in:</p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><strong>Great developer tooling.</strong> Our CI/CD takes ~10m, and we deploy at least 15x a day. A debugger that works out of the box. Everyone on the team has contributed to our developer experience 💪🏾.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><strong>Building blocks to create powerful and customizable products fast.</strong> At the core of Ashby is a set of common components (analytics modeling and query language, policy engine, workflow engine, design system) that we constantly improve.

            "descriptionPlain": "Hi 👋🏾 I’m Abhik https://www.linkedin.com/in/abhikpramanik, Ashby's Co-Founder and VP of Engineering. We’re looking for an ambitious full-stack engineer who is laser-focused on solving customer problems and making the right long-term investments to solve them not only today but in our future features and products.\n\nWhat Ashby gives you in return is the best of both early and growth-stage environments. The agency and no-nonsense of a seed startup: you write product specs, make product and design decisions, and build in an almost-no-meeting culture. While also the product-market fit and scale of a growth-stage startup: tens of thousands of daily users who depend on your software and eagerly await your next feature.\n\nWe have notable customers like Notion, Linear, Shopify, and Snowflake. Our growth and retention metrics are best-in-class among our peers: we have tens of millions in ARR, growing >100% year over year, very low churn, and many years of runway. We’ll share more details once we meet.\n\nYou’ve probably seen this role posted before, and it’s because we’re always expanding the team (we’re on track to double this year). We’re bubbling with ideas on how to support Talent Acquisition through software, and we’ve started the journey of building products beyond Talent Acquisition. We read every application and aim to respond to yours within 3-4 days (often sooner).\n\n\nABOUT THE ROLE AND HOW WE WORK\n\nOur engineering culture strives to recreate the environments where we did our best work as ICs – where we had the ownership and agency to impact our users with creative and innovative software.\n\nI started my career building software for artists in the Visual Effects industry. It was a formative experience for me as a software engineer because success relied on my ability to be a product manager and designer. I talked to artists to understand their needs. I came up with ideas. I did industry research, designed interfaces, and prototyped ideas. I watched artists use what I built and decided what to tackle in the next iteration. No daily stand-ups, no t-shirt sizing, no planning meetings.\n\nI studied computer science to solve problems, not tickets, and this felt exactly like that. I not only felt creative and fulfilled but the agency and ownership we were given as engineers powered an incredible amount of innovation.\n\nInnovation came differently (or not at all) at technology startups beyond the seed stage, often through an engineer’s force of will and ability to push back against culture (rather than any encouragement from it). Engineering was narrowed to implementation and delivery, partly due to the influence of other departments and partly due to the influx of \"Agile\" processes like sprint planning. In those companies, I felt like a JIRA jockey.\n\nAt Ashby, we’re building an environment that is optimistic about what engineers can own and achieve. An environment that embraces innovative engineers, and, frankly, often stays out of their way. As a Product Engineer, you’ll take ownership over a large portion of one of our products and own projects end-to-end (wearing hats traditionally worn by product and design). You’ll research competitors, write product specs, make wireframes, and more. To ground it with examples, product engineers at Ashby have:\n\n - Designed and built automated interview scheduling. This feature automates scheduling by calculating possible times from a pool of interviewers and other constraints, and then presenting these times to the candidate for selection via our responsive web app. This solves the “Calendar Tetris” problem I talk about in \"What We're Building.\"\n\n - Built a generalized declarative filter architecture that allows users to create complex filters for any record with a consistent UI and compile it to SQL in our backend. Many user-facing features use it.\n\n - Specced, designed, and implemented a feature that allows users to complete signing offers entirely within Ashby. This project involved talking to customers to understand their requirements, deciding what technologies to use, building a prototype, and working with other team members to integrate the final implementation into additional features.\n\n\nWHAT WE’RE BUILDING\n\nAs engineers, we are used to tooling that makes us better at what we do. When we started Ashby, we saw the opposite with Talent Acquisition software. Recruiting teams were leveling up how they did their work, but instead of software meeting this new standard, it held them back.\n\nScheduling a final round is an excellent example. Recruiting teams wanted to schedule candidates faster, track interviewer preparation and quality, and do it with half the headcount. A recruiter needed to manually collect availability from the candidate, identify qualified interviewers, perform “Calendar Tetris” to find who is available to interview the candidate, schedule on the earliest date possible, and make any last-minute adjustments as availability changed. They must do this while considering the interview load on each individual and whether interviewers need to be trained and shadowing others. 🥵 TA software didn’t help.\n\nAs hiring managers, we know TA is a critical function, and as engineers, we know software can do better. So, we built and continue to build Ashby to give TA teams the highest standard of tooling. Software that’s intelligent and powerful. Software that provides insights into where they’re failing and automates or simplifies many of the tasks they’re underwater with. We want other functions and departments to be jealous of what TA teams can do with Ashby, and today they often are!\n\n\nWHY YOU SHOULD OR SHOULDN’T APPLY\n\nSoftware engineers come in many flavors, not all of which fit our model. Here are some things to help you decide if this fits you and what you’re looking for:\n\n - You’re not afraid to tackle any part of a technology stack. You do what’s necessary to successfully deliver a feature, whether writing frontend or choosing new infrastructure. We’ll provide a supportive environment to do it successfully (e.g., design system, SRE team).\n\n - You’ve tackled projects with a lot of product and technical ambiguity, and you thrive at the intersection of the two. We’re not building a simple CRUD app, and many of the challenges we tackle require you to use your knowledge of our customers to build powerful abstractions and flexibility in the system to solve a class of problems.\n\n - You know how to strike the right balance between speed and quality. Ashby wasn’t built quickly. We took four years to launch publicly because convincing customers to switch required a high-quality product. However, time isn’t infinite, especially for a startup, so we still move with urgency—we’ve built the equivalent of three or more VC-backed startups with a very small team.\n\n - You are ambitious and always looking to improve your skills. For most engineers, this role will give you more freedom and responsibilities than you’ve experienced in the past. To thrive (and level up), you’ll need to be open to feedback (and we give lots of it).\n\n - You’re an excellent collaborator and communicator. Ownership and freedom don’t mean you work in a vacuum. You’ll need to vet your decisions with the appropriate stakeholders, keep them up to date when necessary, and work with other engineers to get your projects across the finish line. Clear and concise communication helps a lot here!\n\n - You seek to create leverage in your work. The nature of software is that you can often automate or abstract what would be tedious, time-consuming work. Your impatience usually leads to new abstractions, tools to allow Support to debug before Engineering, new lint rules to prevent common bugs, etc.\n\nPut another way, you shouldn’t apply if:\n\n - You need company-driven process and structure to get your projects across the finish line. Sprint planning and well-defined project management processes are things you need or look to others to lead. You’d rather focus on the technical details and challenges.\n\n - You only want to do exciting work. We’re building a team of kind, collaborative folks. Customer issues and investigations are distributed across the team, including our high-level ICs.\n\n - You can get lost in the details. Once you start implementation, it can be hard to take a step back and think about the project as a whole. You like everything to be planned upfront.\n\n - You haven’t led or taken ownership of projects before. You’re used to working with tech leads and taking on tasks distributed by them.\n\n - You want to mentor earlier-career engineers. We rely on engineers owning their projects, so we need engineers with that experience. This requires the team to be reasonably tenured. More than 90% of the team would be considered Senior or above in the industry today, so mentorship opportunities are very limited.\n\n - To you, a tech lead, staff, or principal engineer is someone who spends most of their time project managing or doing architecture reviews. Our most tenured engineers spend most of their time building, and we often trust them with our most challenging problems. While they lead product and technical areas and help other engineers plan their most challenging work, it’s not a requirement, nor do engineers need their sign-off.\n\n\nENGINEERING CULTURE\n\nOur engineering culture is motivated by Benji’s (my Co-founder and CEO) and my belief that a small, talented team, given the right environment, can build high-quality software fast (and work regular hours!). We do it through:\n\n - Minimal process with ownership over decisions normally made by product and design\n\n - Natural collaboration and deliberate communication\n\n - Investing in tools and abstractions that give us leverage\n\n - Putting effort into building a diverse team\n\n\nMINIMAL PROCESS & LOTS OF OWNERSHIP\n\nThe best engineers we’ve worked with delivered reliably magical outcomes. They took customer problems and relentlessly drove them to solutions that were not only successful but often brilliant and creative. While they did this with minimal oversight, stakeholders were never in the dark as to what was going on, and no setback was a surprise.\n\nTraditional product-development processes aren’t meant for the best engineers. Their purpose is to create consistent outcomes regardless of the engineer’s skill. But, consistency comes at the expense of an engineer’s time and freedom—both ingredients necessary to generate those magical outcomes. As a result, process stifles the best engineers and doesn’t give others the opportunity to practice the behaviors that made the best engineers the “best.”\n\nAt Ashby, we want to build an environment that encourages every engineer to be their best. So, at Ashby, every Engineer runs their project. Product Managers (and Designers) build strategy, do customer research, and hand off problem briefs to Engineers. Engineers take on the rest: they research the problem, write product specs, build wireframes, and implement their solution end-to-end. We rely on engineers, not process, to push information outward to the relevant folks (e.g., Product Managers) and pull folks in to help (e.g., Designers, Infra). It’s a new level of ownership for many engineers, but we’d rather an engineer fail a bit and coach up their skills than use process as a crutch. Not everyone succeeds in our culture, but those who do thrive.\n\n\nCOLLABORATION IS NATURAL & COMMUNICATION IS DELIBERATE\n\nOur engineering team consists of lifelong learners who are talented but also humble and kind (meet them here https://www.ashbyhq.com/team!). These attributes create an environment where collaboration happens naturally. We combine this with research, prototyping, and written proposals to see around corners and get feedback from the team across time zones. Focus time is something that we hold sacred, and, with thoughtful and deliberate communication, engineers are in <2h meetings per week (I wrote about it here https://www.ashbyhq.com/blog/company/thoughtful-communication).\n\nTo drive it home, here's a recent calendar of an engineer who has been with us for over 4 years:\n\n[https://app.ashbyhq.com/api/images/user-content/4ea5f68e-c33e-4ac9-831a-e732bee4a303/d4679311-9dba-4031-bf5e-19ce78597ab1/calendar.png]\n\nWe also meet in person at least twice a year, once as a department and once as a company. You also have a small budget to meet up with folks in your city/region.\n\n\nINCREASE LEVERAGE, NOT TEAM SIZE\n\nWe built Ashby with the quality, breadth, and depth that many customers would expect from much larger teams over larger time scales. We’ve done this through investment in:\n\n - Great developer tooling. Our CI/CD takes ~10m, and we deploy at least 15x a day. A debugger that works out of the box. Everyone on the team has contributed to our developer experience 💪🏾.\n\n - Building blocks to create powerful and customizable products fast. At the core of Ashby is a set of common components (analytics modeling and query language, policy engine, workflow engine, design system) that we constantly improve. Each improvement to a common component cascades throughout our app (short video below).\n\nHere’s an impromptu quote from Arjun in our company Slack of what it’s like to build a feature at Ashby:\n\n[https://app.ashbyhq.com/api/images/user-content/4ea5f68e-c33e-4ac9-831a-e732bee4a303/8d94727a-46d8-42a2-9627-ddcd7f822f95/arjun.png]\n\nAnd a demo of one of these building blocks:\n\n\nPUT EFFORT INTO DIVERSITY\n\nDiverse teams drive innovation and better outcomes. Having seen my mother and partner build their careers as minority women in non-diverse fields, I want to make sure Ashby creates opportunities for the next generation of engineers from underrepresented groups.\n\nToday, 21% of engineers at Ashby are from underrepresented groups. It’s not great, and we are taking conscious steps to improve, like sourcing diverse candidates, providing generous paid family leave, no leetcode interviews, and more.\n\n\nINTERVIEW PROCESS\n\nAt Ashby, our team and interview process want to help you show your best self. We’ll dive into past projects and simulate working together via pair programming, writing product and tech specs collaboratively, and talking through decisions. There are no leetcode or whiteboard exercises.\n\nOur interview process is three rounds:\n\n 1. Introduction call with Hiring Manager (15 to 30m, live)\n\n 2. A technical screen where we pair in our actual codebase (1h, live)\n\n 3. Three non-coding interviews that focus on product thinking, technical design, and infrastructure (3h 15m, live can be split across multiple days)\n\nDepending on our leadership team’s bandwidth, we may start with an additional 30m screen with a recruiter.\n\nYour hiring manager will be your main point of contact and prep you for interviews.

We care more about fundamentals (e.g., debugging, abstractions) and how fast you learn. For folks on the team who switched, it's nice seeing changes hot reload versus waiting for XCode to compile 😅.\n\n\nBENEFITS\n\n - Competitive salary and equity.\n\n - 10-year exercise window for stock options. You shouldn’t feel pressure to purchase stock options if you leave Ashby —do it when you feel financially comfortable.\n\n - Unlimited PTO, and we will encourage you to take it.\n\n - A minimum of 12 weeks of fully paid parental leave, covered by Ashby.

            "descriptionHtml": "<p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We’re looking for a curious, rigorous, problem-hungry platform engineer (who codes!) to carry the ball as we bring Ashby to the big leagues. Ashby builds software that lets talent teams build an efficient, delightful, respectful hiring process. Similarly, you’re an engineer who wants to build a “paved road” that excellent engineering teams can safely take to the moon and back.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We have notable customers like Notion, Linear, Shopify, and Snowflake. Our growth and retention metrics are best-in-class among our peers: we have tens of millions in ARR, growing &gt;100% year over year, over 2500 customers, very low churn, and many years of runway. We’ll share more details once we meet, but you now probably have a good idea as to why we're hiring for this role 😅.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We’ve listed this role twice: as a Platform Engineer and Site Reliability Engineer – our team does both, and we are open to candidates who lean towards one or the other. </p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1>About the role and how we work</h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Hi 👋 I’m<a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://uk.linkedin.com/in/colinhoweuk\"> <u>Colin</u></a>, Head of EMEA Engineering. I’ve spent a number of years leading engineering teams in startups, and that has always included being close to infrastructure teams - no matter what name they’ve worn (SRE, infrastructure, platform, etc). I’ve got my hands dirty building the initial infrastructure for startups and know the value a talented infrastructure engineer brings. The rigour, the discipline, the peace and quiet when everything just <em>hums along</em>.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Our infrastructure is in a good place <em>for now</em>. Nothing is static. Ashby continues to grow rapidly, putting strain on our existing infrastructure. We’re always looking to give our customers more powerful hiring software, and building new product features often requires new pieces of infrastructure.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Having herded plenty of <em>snowflakeservers</em> in the past, I’ve learned there’s a better way. I (and Ashby) place a lot of value on infrastructure-as-code. As a Platform Engineer at Ashby, you’ll get to dive into scaling problems, add new capabilities to our platform, and think about how our entire team interacts with infrastructure. All our own engineers own their projects end-to-end and ship with minimal oversight. We don’t put roadblocks to ensure security when common sense will do and we don’t build processes like change management boards around the lowest common denominator. But with great power comes great responsibility: we handle personal and confidential data about some of the biggest decisions we ever make at work. As we grow, more and bigger customers rely on us to be reliable and secure and how we operate internally will need to evolve.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We’re at an inflection point where our ability to scale and deliver a seamless experience has a make-or-break impact – we have some of the fastest growing companies using our platform every day to hire hundreds of people per month. We need someone like you to make good decisions, debug thorny issues, and build us a future-proof platform that can withstand this scale. Our small but mighty infrastructure team has set up a secure and simple environment (we don’t believe in spinning up a new service unless necessary!) for our growing product team to build in. That’s where you come in: you, too, will own projects end-to-end and have an impact on core parts of the Ashby developer and user experience. For instance, you could work on:</p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Optimize <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://www.loom.com/share/32c0cc3eedf2450fb66a901b76186ce4\"><u>our homegrown ultra-dynamic recruiting DSL-to-SQL compiler</u></a>, and create tools to help developers do so</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Create automated guardrails for the security and privacy of our customer data</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Help our developers ship features fast through canary deploys, gradual rollouts and feature flags, while keeping complexity manageable and reducing downtime</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Work with the business and the engineering team to define SLOs and implement the corresponding SLIs.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Ensure all communication with external services supports retries and circuit-breakers.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Implement the infrastructure to support an event-driven architecture and data warehouse.</p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We’re looking for someone who can build systems that an engineer would like to work with: mature and boring but open-minded and approachable. We have to balance reliability with flexibility. Software and its availability are now mission critical to almost every working professional. To be in an SRE in today’s world, you have to be extremely comfortable evaluating risk, those you take and those others take.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1>Why you should or shouldn’t apply</h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You should apply if:</p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You never stop. You get weirdly obsessed about a problem that doesn’t yet make sense, turn it every which way in your head until the explanation dawns. You’ll search every rock, inventory every clue, hunt every mismatch. We do that, too - together we’ll be armed with state-of-the-art monitoring tools and an impressive amount of data, and join you in the adventure.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You don’t take shortcuts. You’re speaking up for the future user, the edge case, the doomsday design. You know product engineers want to build it with you, and see them as allies, where you give them the power and knowledge to access greater things.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You’re someone who cares about what you do and the team you do it with, and want to work with others who do as well. You’ll be on interview panels choosing your next colleagues, and you’ll take that seriously. You only want to work with people who make you better, and want to make you better.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You’ve built infrastructure at a slightly later stage than Ashby is at - you know how to deal with millions of data points, have seen great (or not great) infrastructure make or break customer experience, and have automated everything from provisioning to monitoring and release process.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You’re a Swiss army knife (all nationalities welcome ;) ). You’ll get every hard problem the company faces. You’ll get to do infrastructure updates, security enforcements, database optimization, Kubernetes debugging, and digging through Typescript traces figuring out what doesn’t work. You probably don’t feel like an expert at at least some of that... and that appeals to you.</p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">All that makes for a pretty specific kind of role, and the job isn’t to everyone’s tastes! You should not apply if:</p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You don’t want to make your own decisions on what is the best paved road to build for Ashby, and expect a lead or manager to make the final call on what that is. Our leads (and managers) give ample commentary and feedback on technical decisions and how they’re made, but you ship what you want to build and are accountable for it.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You hate SQL. We have a lot of features built around making the best out of data, and our platform engineers also sometimes dive into a gnarly report or advise engineers on a more performant data model to use.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You don’t want to code. Our SREs are some of our best software engineers and they are just as responsible for the application as the other engineering teams - albeit at a platform level. Reviewing code and submitting code changes will be part of your day to day.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Your primary mode of communicating best practices to engineers is live meetings. We’re a very async culture and written communication (and code) is how changes get made. As an Ashby SRE, you will need to share new tooling and best practices with engineers faster than your next meeting opportunity will take you.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You’ve never delivered a project, on your own, without someone prodding you for updates. We have no project or delivery managers to fill your calendar with busy work, but the flip side is you have to do your project management, seek the help you need to get unstuck and cut scope when it’s worthwhile.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p></li></ul><h1>Technology Stack</h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">I’m sharing our tech stack with the caveat that we don’t require previous experience in it: TypeScript (frontend &amp; backend), Node.js, React, Apollo GraphQL, Postgres, Redis.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We use Datadog and Sentry on 100% cloud-based (AWS) infra. We take developer experience and reliability seriously: all engineers are on call in a follow-the-sun model, and everyone contributes to developer tooling.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1>What We’re Building</h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">As engineers, we are used to tooling that makes us <strong>better</strong> at what we do. When we started Ashby, we saw the opposite with Talent Acquisition software. Recruiting teams were leveling up how they did their work, but instead of software meeting this new standard, it held them back.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Scheduling a final round is an excellent example. Recruiting teams wanted to schedule candidates faster, track interviewer preparation and quality, and do it with half the headcount. A recruiter needed to manually collect availability from the candidate, identify qualified interviewers, perform “Calendar Tetris” to find who is available to interview the candidate, schedule on the earliest date possible, and make any last-minute adjustments as availability changed. They must do this while considering the interview load on each individual and whether interviewers need to be trained and shadowing others. 🥵 TA software didn’t help.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">As hiring managers, we know TA is a critical function, and as engineers, we know software can do better. So, we built and continue to build Ashby to give TA teams the <em>highest</em> standard of tooling. Software that’s intelligent and powerful. Software that provides insights into where they’re failing and automates or simplifies many of the tasks they’re underwater with. We want other functions and departments to be jealous of what TA teams can do with Ashby, and today they often are!</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1>Engineering Culture</h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Our engineering culture is motivated by <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/abhikpramanik/\"><u>Abhik</u></a> and <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/benjaminencz/\"><u>Benji</u></a>’s (our co-founders) belief that a small talented team, given the right environment, can build high-quality software fast (and work regular hours!). We do it through:</p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Minimal process with ownership over decisions normally made by product and design</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Natural collaboration and deliberate communication</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Investing in tools and abstractions that give us leverage</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Putting effort into building a diverse team</p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h2><strong>Minimal Process &amp; Lots of Ownership</strong></h2><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">The best engineers we’ve worked with delivered reliably magical outcomes. They took customer problems and relentlessly drove them to solutions that were not only successful but often brilliant and creative. While they did this with minimal oversight, stakeholders were never in the dark as to what was going on, and no setback was a surprise.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Traditional product-development processes aren’t meant for the best engineers. Their purpose is to create consistent outcomes regardless of the engineer’s skill. But, consistency comes at the expense of an engineer’s time and freedom—both ingredients necessary to generate those magical outcomes. As a result, process stifles the best engineers and doesn’t give others the opportunity to practice the behaviors that made the best engineers the “best.”</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">At Ashby, we want to build an environment that encourages every engineer to be their best. So, at Ashby, every Engineer runs their project. Product Managers (and Designers) build strategy, do customer research, and hand off problem briefs to Engineers. Engineers take on the rest: they research the problem, write product specs, build wireframes, and implement their solution end-to-end. We rely on engineers, not process, to push information outward to the relevant folks (e.g., Product Managers) and pull folks in to help (e.g., Designers, Infra). It’s a new level of ownership for many engineers, but we’d rather an engineer fail a bit and coach up their skills than use process as a crutch. Not everyone succeeds in our culture, but those who do <em>thrive</em>.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h2><strong>Collaboration is Natural &amp; Communication is Deliberate</strong></h2><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Our engineering team consists of lifelong learners who are talented but also humble and kind (meet them <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://www.ashbyhq.com/team\"><u>here</u></a>!). These attributes create an environment where collaboration happens naturally. We combine this with research, prototyping, and written proposals to see around corners and get feedback from the team across time zones. Focus time is something that we hold sacred, and, with thoughtful and deliberate communication, engineers are in &lt;2h meetings per week (Abhik wrote about it <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://www.ashbyhq.com/blog/company/thoughtful-communication\"><u>here</u></a>).</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">To drive it home, here's a recent calendar of an engineer who has been with us for over 4 years:</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><div style=\"text-align:left\"><img style=\"max-width:100%\" src=\"https://app.ashbyhq.com/api/images/user-content/4ea5f68e-c33e-4ac9-831a-e732bee4a303/d4679311-9dba-4031-bf5e-19ce78597ab1/calendar.png\" /></div><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We also meet in person at least twice a year, once as a department and once as a company. You also have a small budget to meet up with folks in your city/region.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h2><strong>Increase Leverage, not Team Size</strong></h2><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We built Ashby with the quality, breadth, and depth that many customers would expect from much larger teams over larger time scales. We’ve done this through investment in:</p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><strong>Great developer tooling.</strong> Our CI/CD takes ~10m, and we deploy at least 15x a day. A debugger that works out of the box. Everyone on the team has contributed to our developer experience 💪🏾.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><strong>Building blocks to create powerful and customizable products fast.</strong> At the core of Ashby is a set of common components (analytics modeling and query language, policy engine, workflow engine, design system) that we constantly improve. Each improvement to a common component cascades throughout our app (short video below).</p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Here’s an impromptu quote from Arjun in our company Slack of what it’s like to build a feature at Ashby:</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><div style=\"text-align:left\"><img style=\"max-width:100%\" src=\"https://app.ashbyhq.com/api/images/user-content/4ea5f68e-c33e-4ac9-831a-e732bee4a303/8d94727a-46d8-42a2-9627-ddcd7f822f95/arjun.png\" /></div><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">And a demo of one of these building blocks:</p><div><div style=\"left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:62.5%\"><iframe src=\"https://embedded-media.ashbyhq.com/embed/4ea5f68e-c33e-4ac9-831a-e732bee4a303/9a5f032d-c731-411e-98cf-261517156f01\" style=\"top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0\" allowfullscreen scrolling=\"no\" allow=\"encrypted-media *; picture-in-picture *;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-presentation\"></iframe></div></div><h2><strong>Put Effort into Diversity</strong></h2><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Diverse teams drive innovation and better outcomes. Having seen my mother and partner build their careers as minority women in non-diverse fields, I want to make sure Ashby creates opportunities for the next generation of engineers from underrepresented groups.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Today, 21% of engineers at Ashby are from underrepresented groups. It’s not great, and we are taking conscious steps to improve, like sourcing diverse candidates, providing generous paid family leave, no leetcode interviews, and more.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1>Interview Process</h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">At Ashby, our team and interview process want to help you show your best self. We’ll dive into past projects and simulate working together via pair programming, writing product and tech specs collaboratively, and talking through decisions. There are no leetcode or whiteboard exercises.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Our interview process is three rounds:</p><ol style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Introduction call with Hiring Manager (15 to 30m, live)</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">A technical screen where we pair in our actual codebase (1h, live)</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Three non-coding interviews that focus on technical design, debugging incidents, and infrastructure (3h 15m, live can be split across multiple days)</p></li></ol><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Depending on our leadership team’s bandwidth, we may start with an <em>additional</em> 30m screen with a recruiter.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Your hiring manager will be your main point of contact and prep you for interviews. Each round will have written guidance so you know what to expect (you’ll need minimal preparation). You’ll meet 4 to 6 people in engineering (with 5-15 minutes in each interview to ask them questions). If we don’t give an offer, we’ll provide feedback!</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1><strong>Your First Three Months at Ashby</strong></h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We want an exceptional onboarding experience for every new hire. At Ashby, your dev environment is set up with a single script, you push your first product change on day one, and you spend the rest of your time shipping product changes that give you a tour of our codebase and best practices. The product changes increase in scope and ambiguity from simple copy changes to the delivery of a prominent, impactful feature. Your manager will do a 30, 60, and 90-day review to give feedback and calibrate on how we work together.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">It’s a team effort to get you successfully onboarded; you’ll have a peer paired with you to answer questions, pair program, and check in often to see if you need help. The rest of the team will run training sessions on our culture, product, engineering process, and technical architecture.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1>Benefits</h1><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Competitive salary and equity.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">10-year exercise window for stock options. You shouldn’t feel pressure to purchase stock options if you leave Ashby —do it when you feel financially comfortable.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Unlimited PTO, and we will encourage you to take it.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">A minimum of 12 weeks of fully paid parental leave, covered by Ashby. For folks outside the US, it may be longer to be in line with regional requirements.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Generous equipment, software, and office furniture budget. Get what you need to be happy and productive!</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">$100/month education budget with more expensive items (like conferences) covered with manager approval.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">If you’re in the US, we offer top-tier health insurance for you and your dependents, with 100% of premiums covered by Ashby. In other countries, we provide high-quality supplemental health insurance for you and your dependents, also fully covered by us.</p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Ashby’s success hinges on hiring great people and creating an environment where we can be happy, feel challenged, and do our best work. We’re being deliberate about building that environment from the ground up. I hope that excites you enough to apply.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>Ashby provides equal employment opportunities (EEO) to all employees and applicants for employment without regard to race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability, genetics, sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression.

For instance, you could work on:\n\n - Optimize our homegrown ultra-dynamic recruiting DSL-to-SQL compiler https://www.loom.com/share/32c0cc3eedf2450fb66a901b76186ce4, and create tools to help developers do so\n\n - Create automated guardrails for the security and privacy of our customer data\n\n - Help our developers ship features fast through canary deploys, gradual rollouts and feature flags, while keeping complexity manageable and reducing downtime\n\n - Work with the business and the engineering team to define SLOs and implement the corresponding SLIs.\n\n - Ensure all communication with external services supports retries and circuit-breakers.\n\n - Implement the infrastructure to support an event-driven architecture and data warehouse.\n\nWe’re looking for someone who can build systems that an engineer would like to work with: mature and boring but open-minded and approachable. We have to balance reliability with flexibility. Software and its availability are now mission critical to almost every working professional. To be in an SRE in today’s world, you have to be extremely comfortable evaluating risk, those you take and those others take.\n\n\nWHY YOU SHOULD OR SHOULDN’T APPLY\n\nYou should apply if:\n\n - You never stop. You get weirdly obsessed about a problem that doesn’t yet make sense, turn it every which way in your head until the explanation dawns. You’ll search every rock, inventory every clue, hunt every mismatch. We do that, too - together we’ll be armed with state-of-the-art monitoring tools and an impressive amount of data, and join you in the adventure.\n\n - You don’t take shortcuts. You’re speaking up for the future user, the edge case, the doomsday design. You know product engineers want to build it with you, and see them as allies, where you give them the power and knowledge to access greater things.\n\n - You’re someone who cares about what you do and the team you do it with, and want to work with others who do as well. You’ll be on interview panels choosing your next colleagues, and you’ll take that seriously. You only want to work with people who make you better, and want to make you better.\n\n - You’ve built infrastructure at a slightly later stage than Ashby is at - you know how to deal with millions of data points, have seen great (or not great) infrastructure make or break customer experience, and have automated everything from provisioning to monitoring and release process.\n\n - You’re a Swiss army knife (all nationalities welcome ;) ). You’ll get every hard problem the company faces. You’ll get to do infrastructure updates, security enforcements, database optimization, Kubernetes debugging, and digging through Typescript traces figuring out what doesn’t work. You probably don’t feel like an expert at at least some of that... and that appeals to you.\n\nAll that makes for a pretty specific kind of role, and the job isn’t to everyone’s tastes! You should not apply if:\n\n - You don’t want to make your own decisions on what is the best paved road to build for Ashby, and expect a lead or manager to make the final call on what that is. Our leads (and managers) give ample commentary and feedback on technical decisions and how they’re made, but you ship what you want to build and are accountable for it.\n\n - You hate SQL. We have a lot of features built around making the best out of data, and our platform engineers also sometimes dive into a gnarly report or advise engineers on a more performant data model to use.\n\n - You don’t want to code. Our SREs are some of our best software engineers and they are just as responsible for the application as the other engineering teams - albeit at a platform level. Reviewing code and submitting code changes will be part of your day to day.\n\n - Your primary mode of communicating best practices to engineers is live meetings. We’re a very async culture and written communication (and code) is how changes get made. As an Ashby SRE, you will need to share new tooling and best practices with engineers faster than your next meeting opportunity will take you.\n\n - You’ve never delivered a project, on your own, without someone prodding you for updates. We have no project or delivery managers to fill your calendar with busy work, but the flip side is you have to do your project management, seek the help you need to get unstuck and cut scope when it’s worthwhile.\n\n\nTECHNOLOGY STACK\n\nI’m sharing our tech stack with the caveat that we don’t require previous experience in it: TypeScript (frontend & backend), Node.js, React, Apollo GraphQL, Postgres, Redis.\n\nWe use Datadog and Sentry on 100% cloud-based (AWS) infra. We take developer experience and reliability seriously: all engineers are on call in a follow-the-sun model, and everyone contributes to developer tooling.\n\n\nWHAT WE’RE BUILDING\n\nAs engineers, we are used to tooling that makes us better at what we do. When we started Ashby, we saw the opposite with Talent Acquisition software. Recruiting teams were leveling up how they did their work, but instead of software meeting this new standard, it held them back.\n\nScheduling a final round is an excellent example. Recruiting teams wanted to schedule candidates faster, track interviewer preparation and quality, and do it with half the headcount. A recruiter needed to manually collect availability from the candidate, identify qualified interviewers, perform “Calendar Tetris” to find who is available to interview the candidate, schedule on the earliest date possible, and make any last-minute adjustments as availability changed. They must do this while considering the interview load on each individual and whether interviewers need to be trained and shadowing others. 🥵 TA software didn’t help.\n\nAs hiring managers, we know TA is a critical function, and as engineers, we know software can do better. So, we built and continue to build Ashby to give TA teams the highest standard of tooling. Software that’s intelligent and powerful. Software that provides insights into where they’re failing and automates or simplifies many of the tasks they’re underwater with. We want other functions and departments to be jealous of what TA teams can do with Ashby, and today they often are!\n\n\nENGINEERING CULTURE\n\nOur engineering culture is motivated by Abhik https://www.linkedin.com/in/abhikpramanik/ and Benji https://www.linkedin.com/in/benjaminencz/’s (our co-founders) belief that a small talented team, given the right environment, can build high-quality software fast (and work regular hours!). We do it through:\n\n - Minimal process with ownership over decisions normally made by product and design\n\n - Natural collaboration and deliberate communication\n\n - Investing in tools and abstractions that give us leverage\n\n - Putting effort into building a diverse team\n\n\nMINIMAL PROCESS & LOTS OF OWNERSHIP\n\nThe best engineers we’ve worked with delivered reliably magical outcomes. They took customer problems and relentlessly drove them to solutions that were not only successful but often brilliant and creative. While they did this with minimal oversight, stakeholders were never in the dark as to what was going on, and no setback was a surprise.\n\nTraditional product-development processes aren’t meant for the best engineers. Their purpose is to create consistent outcomes regardless of the engineer’s skill. But, consistency comes at the expense of an engineer’s time and freedom—both ingredients necessary to generate those magical outcomes. As a result, process stifles the best engineers and doesn’t give others the opportunity to practice the behaviors that made the best engineers the “best.”\n\nAt Ashby, we want to build an environment that encourages every engineer to be their best. So, at Ashby, every Engineer runs their project. Product Managers (and Designers) build strategy, do customer research, and hand off problem briefs to Engineers. Engineers take on the rest: they research the problem, write product specs, build wireframes, and implement their solution end-to-end. We rely on engineers, not process, to push information outward to the relevant folks (e.g., Product Managers) and pull folks in to help (e.g., Designers, Infra). It’s a new level of ownership for many engineers, but we’d rather an engineer fail a bit and coach up their skills than use process as a crutch. Not everyone succeeds in our culture, but those who do thrive.\n\n\nCOLLABORATION IS NATURAL & COMMUNICATION IS DELIBERATE\n\nOur engineering team consists of lifelong learners who are talented but also humble and kind (meet them here https://www.ashbyhq.com/team!). These attributes create an environment where collaboration happens naturally. We combine this with research, prototyping, and written proposals to see around corners and get feedback from the team across time zones. Focus time is something that we hold sacred, and, with thoughtful and deliberate communication, engineers are in <2h meetings per week (Abhik wrote about it here https://www.ashbyhq.com/blog/company/thoughtful-communication).\n\nTo drive it home, here's a recent calendar of an engineer who has been with us for over 4 years:\n\n[https://app.ashbyhq.com/api/images/user-content/4ea5f68e-c33e-4ac9-831a-e732bee4a303/d4679311-9dba-4031-bf5e-19ce78597ab1/calendar.png]\n\nWe also meet in person at least twice a year, once as a department and once as a company. You also have a small budget to meet up with folks in your city/region.\n\n\nINCREASE LEVERAGE, NOT TEAM SIZE\n\nWe built Ashby with the quality, breadth, and depth that many customers would expect from much larger teams over larger time scales. We’ve done this through investment in:\n\n - Great developer tooling. Our CI/CD takes ~10m, and we deploy at least 15x a day. A debugger that works out of the box. Everyone on the team has contributed to our developer experience 💪🏾.\n\n - Building blocks to create powerful and customizable products fast. At the core of Ashby is a set of common components (analytics modeling and query language, policy engine, workflow engine, design system) that we constantly improve. Each improvement to a common component cascades throughout our app (short video below).\n\nHere’s an impromptu quote from Arjun in our company Slack of what it’s like to build a feature at Ashby:\n\n[https://app.ashbyhq.com/api/images/user-content/4ea5f68e-c33e-4ac9-831a-e732bee4a303/8d94727a-46d8-42a2-9627-ddcd7f822f95/arjun.png]\n\nAnd a demo of one of these building blocks:\n\n\nPUT EFFORT INTO DIVERSITY\n\nDiverse teams drive innovation and better outcomes. Having seen my mother and partner build their careers as minority women in non-diverse fields, I want to make sure Ashby creates opportunities for the next generation of engineers from underrepresented groups.\n\nToday, 21% of engineers at Ashby are from underrepresented groups. It’s not great, and we are taking conscious steps to improve, like sourcing diverse candidates, providing generous paid family leave, no leetcode interviews, and more.\n\n\nINTERVIEW PROCESS\n\nAt Ashby, our team and interview process want to help you show your best self. We’ll dive into past projects and simulate working together via pair programming, writing product and tech specs collaboratively, and talking through decisions. There are no leetcode or whiteboard exercises.\n\nOur interview process is three rounds:\n\n 1. Introduction call with Hiring Manager (15 to 30m, live)\n\n 2. A technical screen where we pair in our actual codebase (1h, live)\n\n 3. Three non-coding interviews that focus on technical design, debugging incidents, and infrastructure (3h 15m, live can be split across multiple days)\n\nDepending on our leadership team’s bandwidth, we may start with an additional 30m screen with a recruiter.\n\nYour hiring manager will be your main point of contact and prep you for interviews. Each round will have written guidance so you know what to expect (you’ll need minimal preparation). You’ll meet 4 to 6 people in engineering (with 5-15 minutes in each interview to ask them questions). If we don’t give an offer, we’ll provide feedback!\n\n\nYOUR FIRST THREE MONTHS AT ASHBY\n\nWe want an exceptional onboarding experience for every new hire. At Ashby, your dev environment is set up with a single script, you push your first product change on day one, and you spend the rest of your time shipping product changes that give you a tour of our codebase and best practices. The product changes increase in scope and ambiguity from simple copy changes to the delivery of a prominent, impactful feature. Your manager will do a 30, 60, and 90-day review to give feedback and calibrate on how we work together.\n\nIt’s a team effort to get you successfully onboarded; you’ll have a peer paired with you to answer questions, pair program, and check in often to see if you need help. The rest of the team will run training sessions on our culture, product, engineering process, and technical architecture.\n\n\nBENEFITS\n\n - Competitive salary and equity.\n\n - 10-year exercise window for stock options. You shouldn’t feel pressure to purchase stock options if you leave Ashby —do it when you feel financially comfortable.\n\n - Unlimited PTO, and we will encourage you to take it.\n\n - A minimum of 12 weeks of fully paid parental leave, covered by Ashby. For folks outside the US, it may be longer to be in line with regional requirements.\n\n - Generous equipment, software, and office furniture budget. Get what you need to be happy and productive!\n\n - $100/month education budget with more expensive items (like conferences) covered with manager approval.\n\n - If you’re in the US, we offer top-tier health insurance for you and your dependents, with 100% of premiums covered by Ashby. In other countries, we provide high-quality supplemental health insurance for you and your dependents, also fully covered by us.\n\nAshby’s success hinges on hiring great people and creating an environment where we can be happy, feel challenged, and do our best work. We’re being deliberate about building that environment from the ground up. I hope that excites you enough to apply.\n\nAshby provides equal employment opportunities (EEO) to all employees and applicants for employment without regard to race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability, genetics, sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression. We are committed to a diverse and inclusive workforce and welcome people from all backgrounds, experiences, perspectives, and abilities.",

As someone who could design and build software, this position is close to my heart. I always felt I had a unique perspective because I could play with design ideas and iterate <em>in code</em>. My ideas could start in Figma but then be grounded (or sometimes more creative) in code. My prototypes used actual logic and data. My changes cascaded throughout the app for comprehensive critique (thanks, React component system!). But, every company made me pick one —I couldn’t design <em>and </em>build. At Ashby, you can.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">While every engineer can design <em>and </em>build, you’ll tackle our most challenging design problems and help others improve their designs by expanding and enhancing our in-house design system and consulting on bespoke work. To ground it with examples, engineers who can design at Ashby have:</p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Redesigned our mobile web app by talking with customers who use it often, wireframing new flows, implementing its design system, and using it to make the wireframes a reality.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Built a set of flexible, composable components in our design system that allow other engineers to build custom autocompletes. These autocompletes can contain filters, options to create new records, etc.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Helped another engineer improve their design's information hierarchy and scannability for viewing a candidate’s assessments. Recruiters can quickly parse information and pick out anomalies.</p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">These projects reflect what we’re accomplishing at Ashby: improving the productivity of working professionals (starting with talent teams) with intelligent and powerful software. We put a lot of effort into designing products that are approachable to beginners but mastered &amp; extended by power users. In many ways, spreadsheets set the bar here.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We have notable customers like Notion, Linear, Shopify, and Snowflake. Our growth and retention metrics are best-in-class among our peers: we have tens of millions in ARR, growing &gt;100% year over year, over 2500 customers, very low churn, and many years of runway. We’ll share more details once we meet, but you now probably have a good idea as to why we're hiring for this role 😅.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1>What We’re Building</h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">As engineers, we are used to tooling that makes us <strong>better</strong> at what we do.

            "descriptionPlain": "Hi 👋🏾 I’m Abhik https://www.linkedin.com/in/abhikpramanik/, Ashby's Co-Founder and VP of Engineering. As someone who could design and build software, this position is close to my heart. I always felt I had a unique perspective because I could play with design ideas and iterate in code. My ideas could start in Figma but then be grounded (or sometimes more creative) in code. My prototypes used actual logic and data. My changes cascaded throughout the app for comprehensive critique (thanks, React component system!). But, every company made me pick one —I couldn’t design and build. At Ashby, you can.\n\nWhile every engineer can design and build, you’ll tackle our most challenging design problems and help others improve their designs by expanding and enhancing our in-house design system and consulting on bespoke work. To ground it with examples, engineers who can design at Ashby have:\n\n - Redesigned our mobile web app by talking with customers who use it often, wireframing new flows, implementing its design system, and using it to make the wireframes a reality.\n\n - Built a set of flexible, composable components in our design system that allow other engineers to build custom autocompletes. These autocompletes can contain filters, options to create new records, etc.\n\n - Helped another engineer improve their design's information hierarchy and scannability for viewing a candidate’s assessments. Recruiters can quickly parse information and pick out anomalies.\n\nThese projects reflect what we’re accomplishing at Ashby: improving the productivity of working professionals (starting with talent teams) with intelligent and powerful software. We put a lot of effort into designing products that are approachable to beginners but mastered & extended by power users. In many ways, spreadsheets set the bar here.\n\nWe have notable customers like Notion, Linear, Shopify, and Snowflake. Our growth and retention metrics are best-in-class among our peers: we have tens of millions in ARR, growing >100% year over year, over 2500 customers, very low churn, and many years of runway. We’ll share more details once we meet, but you now probably have a good idea as to why we're hiring for this role 😅.\n\n\nWHAT WE’RE BUILDING\n\nAs engineers, we are used to tooling that makes us better at what we do. When we started Ashby, we saw the opposite with Talent Acquisition software. Recruiting teams were leveling up how they did their work, but instead of software meeting this new standard, it held them back.\n\nScheduling a final round is an excellent example. Recruiting teams wanted to schedule candidates faster, track interviewer preparation and quality, and do it with half the headcount. A recruiter needed to manually collect availability from the candidate, identify qualified interviewers, perform “Calendar Tetris” to find who is available to interview the candidate, schedule on the earliest date possible, and make any last-minute adjustments as availability changed. They must do this while considering the interview load on each individual and whether interviewers need to be trained and shadowing others. 🥵 TA software didn’t help.\n\nAs hiring managers, we know TA is a critical function, and as engineers, we know software can do better. So, we built and continue to build Ashby to give TA teams the highest standard of tooling. Software that’s intelligent and powerful. Software that provides insights into where they’re failing and automates or simplifies many of the tasks they’re underwater with. We want other functions and departments to be jealous of what TA teams can do with Ashby, and today they often are!\n\n\nENGINEERING CULTURE\n\nOur engineering culture is motivated by Benji’s (my Co-founder and CEO) and my belief that a small, talented team, given the right environment, can build high-quality software fast (and work regular hours!). We do it through:\n\n - Minimal process with ownership over decisions normally made by product and design\n\n - Natural collaboration and deliberate communication\n\n - Investing in tools and abstractions that give us leverage\n\n - Putting effort into building a diverse team\n\n\nMINIMAL PROCESS & LOTS OF OWNERSHIP\n\nThe best engineers we’ve worked with delivered reliably magical outcomes. They took customer problems and relentlessly drove them to solutions that were not only successful but often brilliant and creative. While they did this with minimal oversight, stakeholders were never in the dark as to what was going on, and no setback was a surprise.\n\nTraditional product-development processes aren’t meant for the best engineers. Their purpose is to create consistent outcomes regardless of the engineer’s skill. But, consistency comes at the expense of an engineer’s time and freedom—both ingredients necessary to generate those magical outcomes. As a result, process stifles the best engineers and doesn’t give others the opportunity to practice the behaviors that made the best engineers the “best.”\n\nAt Ashby, we want to build an environment that encourages every engineer to be their best. So, at Ashby, every Engineer runs their project. Product Managers (and Designers) build strategy, do customer research, and hand off problem briefs to Engineers. Engineers take on the rest: they research the problem, write product specs, build wireframes, and implement their solution end-to-end. We rely on engineers, not process, to push information outward to the relevant folks (e.g., Product Managers) and pull folks in to help (e.g., Designers, Infra). It’s a new level of ownership for many engineers, but we’d rather an engineer fail a bit and coach up their skills than use process as a crutch. Not everyone succeeds in our culture, but those who do thrive.\n\n\nCOLLABORATION IS NATURAL & COMMUNICATION IS DELIBERATE\n\nOur engineering team consists of lifelong learners who are talented but also humble and kind (meet them here https://www.ashbyhq.com/team!). These attributes create an environment where collaboration happens naturally. We combine this with research, prototyping, and written proposals to see around corners and get feedback from the team across time zones. Focus time is something that we hold sacred, and, with thoughtful and deliberate communication, engineers are in <2h meetings per week (I wrote about it here https://www.ashbyhq.com/blog/company/thoughtful-communication).\n\nTo drive it home, here's a recent calendar of an engineer who has been with us for over 4 years:\n\n[https://app.ashbyhq.com/api/images/user-content/4ea5f68e-c33e-4ac9-831a-e732bee4a303/d4679311-9dba-4031-bf5e-19ce78597ab1/calendar.png]\n\nWe also meet in person at least twice a year, once as a department and once as a company. You also have a small budget to meet up with folks in your city/region.\n\n\nINCREASE LEVERAGE, NOT TEAM SIZE\n\nWe built Ashby with the quality, breadth, and depth that many customers would expect from much larger teams over larger time scales. We’ve done this through investment in:\n\n - Great developer tooling. Our CI/CD takes ~10m, and we deploy at least 15x a day. A debugger that works out of the box. Everyone on the team has contributed to our developer experience 💪🏾.\n\n - Building blocks to create powerful and customizable products fast. At the core of Ashby is a set of common components (analytics modeling and query language, policy engine, workflow engine, design system) that we constantly improve. Each improvement to a common component cascades throughout our app (short video below).\n\nHere’s an impromptu quote from Arjun in our company Slack of what it’s like to build a feature at Ashby:\n\n[https://app.ashbyhq.com/api/images/user-content/4ea5f68e-c33e-4ac9-831a-e732bee4a303/8d94727a-46d8-42a2-9627-ddcd7f822f95/arjun.png]\n\nAnd a demo of one of these building blocks:\n\n\nPUT EFFORT INTO DIVERSITY\n\nDiverse teams drive innovation and better outcomes. Having seen my mother and partner build their careers as minority women in non-diverse fields, I want to make sure Ashby creates opportunities for the next generation of engineers from underrepresented groups.\n\nToday, 21% of engineers at Ashby are from underrepresented groups.

            "descriptionHtml": "<p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Hi 👋🏾 I’m <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/abhikpramanik/\"><u>Abhik</u></a>, Ashby's Co-Founder and VP of Engineering. As someone who could design and build software, this position is close to my heart. I always felt I had a unique perspective because I could play with design ideas and iterate <em>in code</em>. My ideas could start in Figma but then be grounded (or sometimes more creative) in code. My prototypes used actual logic and data. My changes cascaded throughout the app for comprehensive critique (thanks, React component system!). But, every company made me pick one —I couldn’t design <em>and </em>build. At Ashby, you can.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">While every engineer can design <em>and </em>build, you’ll tackle our most challenging design problems and help others improve their designs by expanding and enhancing our in-house design system and consulting on bespoke work. To ground it with examples, engineers who can design at Ashby have:</p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Redesigned our mobile web app by talking with customers who use it often, wireframing new flows, implementing its design system, and using it to make the wireframes a reality.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Built a set of flexible, composable components in our design system that allow other engineers to build custom autocompletes. These autocompletes can contain filters, options to create new records, etc.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Helped another engineer improve their design's information hierarchy and scannability for viewing a candidate’s assessments. Recruiters can quickly parse information and pick out anomalies.</p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">These projects reflect what we’re accomplishing at Ashby: improving the productivity of working professionals (starting with talent teams) with intelligent and powerful software. We put a lot of effort into designing products that are approachable to beginners but mastered &amp; extended by power users. In many ways, spreadsheets set the bar here.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We have notable customers like Notion, Linear, Shopify, and Snowflake. Our growth and retention metrics are best-in-class among our peers: we have tens of millions in ARR, growing &gt;100% year over year, over 2500 customers, very low churn, and many years of runway. We’ll share more details once we meet, but you now probably have a good idea as to why we're hiring for this role 😅.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1>What We’re Building</h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">As engineers, we are used to tooling that makes us <strong>better</strong> at what we do. When we started Ashby, we saw the opposite with Talent Acquisition software. Recruiting teams were leveling up how they did their work, but instead of software meeting this new standard, it held them back.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Scheduling a final round is an excellent example. Recruiting teams wanted to schedule candidates faster, track interviewer preparation and quality, and do it with half the headcount. A recruiter needed to manually collect availability from the candidate, identify qualified interviewers, perform “Calendar Tetris” to find who is available to interview the candidate, schedule on the earliest date possible, and make any last-minute adjustments as availability changed. They must do this while considering the interview load on each individual and whether interviewers need to be trained and shadowing others. 🥵 TA software didn’t help.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">As hiring managers, we know TA is a critical function, and as engineers, we know software can do better. So, we built and continue to build Ashby to give TA teams the <em>highest</em> standard of tooling. Software that’s intelligent and powerful. Software that provides insights into where they’re failing and automates or simplifies many of the tasks they’re underwater with. We want other functions and departments to be jealous of what TA teams can do with Ashby, and today they often are!</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1>Engineering Culture</h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Our engineering culture is motivated by Benji’s (my Co-founder and CEO) and my belief that a small, talented team, given the right environment, can build high-quality software fast (and work regular hours!). We do it through:</p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Minimal process with ownership over decisions normally made by product and design</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Natural collaboration and deliberate communication</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Investing in tools and abstractions that give us leverage</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Putting effort into building a diverse team</p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h2><strong>Minimal Process &amp; Lots of Ownership</strong></h2><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">The best engineers we’ve worked with delivered reliably magical outcomes. They took customer problems and relentlessly drove them to solutions that were not only successful but often brilliant and creative. While they did this with minimal oversight, stakeholders were never in the dark as to what was going on, and no setback was a surprise.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Traditional product-development processes aren’t meant for the best engineers. Their purpose is to create consistent outcomes regardless of the engineer’s skill. But, consistency comes at the expense of an engineer’s time and freedom—both ingredients necessary to generate those magical outcomes. As a result, process stifles the best engineers and doesn’t give others the opportunity to practice the behaviors that made the best engineers the “best.”</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">At Ashby, we want to build an environment that encourages every engineer to be their best. So, at Ashby, every Engineer runs their project. Product Managers (and Designers) build strategy, do customer research, and hand off problem briefs to Engineers. Engineers take on the rest: they research the problem, write product specs, build wireframes, and implement their solution end-to-end. We rely on engineers, not process, to push information outward to the relevant folks (e.g., Product Managers) and pull folks in to help (e.g., Designers, Infra). It’s a new level of ownership for many engineers, but we’d rather an engineer fail a bit and coach up their skills than use process as a crutch. Not everyone succeeds in our culture, but those who do <em>thrive</em>.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h2><strong>Collaboration is Natural &amp; Communication is Deliberate</strong></h2><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Our engineering team consists of lifelong learners who are talented but also humble and kind (meet them <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://www.ashbyhq.com/team\"><u>here</u></a>!). These attributes create an environment where collaboration happens naturally. We combine this with research, prototyping, and written proposals to see around corners and get feedback from the team across time zones. Focus time is something that we hold sacred, and, with thoughtful and deliberate communication, engineers are in &lt;2h meetings per week (I wrote about it <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://www.ashbyhq.com/blog/company/thoughtful-communication\"><u>here</u></a>).</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">To drive it home, here's a recent calendar of an engineer who has been with us for over 4 years:</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><div style=\"text-align:left\"><img style=\"max-width:100%\" src=\"https://app.ashbyhq.com/api/images/user-content/4ea5f68e-c33e-4ac9-831a-e732bee4a303/d4679311-9dba-4031-bf5e-19ce78597ab1/calendar.png\" /></div><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We also meet in person at least twice a year, once as a department and once as a company. You also have a small budget to meet up with folks in your city/region.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h2><strong>Increase Leverage, not Team Size</strong></h2><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We built Ashby with the quality, breadth, and depth that many customers would expect from much larger teams over larger time scales. We’ve done this through investment in:</p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><strong>Great developer tooling.</strong> Our CI/CD takes ~10m, and we deploy at least 15x a day. A debugger that works out of the box. Everyone on the team has contributed to our developer experience 💪🏾.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><strong>Building blocks to create powerful and customizable products fast.</strong> At the core of Ashby is a set of common components (analytics modeling and query language, policy engine, workflow engine, design system) that we constantly improve. Each improvement to a common component cascades throughout our app (short video below).</p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Here’s an impromptu quote from Arjun in our company Slack of what it’s like to build a feature at Ashby:</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><div style=\"text-align:left\"><img style=\"max-width:100%\" src=\"https://app.ashbyhq.com/api/images/user-content/4ea5f68e-c33e-4ac9-831a-e732bee4a303/8d94727a-46d8-42a2-9627-ddcd7f822f95/arjun.png\" /></div><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">And a demo of one of these building blocks:</p><div><div style=\"left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:62.5%\"><iframe src=\"https://embedded-media.ashbyhq.com/embed/4ea5f68e-c33e-4ac9-831a-e732bee4a303/9a5f032d-c731-411e-98cf-261517156f01\" style=\"top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0\" allowfullscreen scrolling=\"no\" allow=\"encrypted-media *; picture-in-picture *;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-presentation\"></iframe></div></div><h2><strong>Put Effort into Diversity</strong></h2><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Diverse teams drive innovation and better outcomes. Having seen my mother and partner build their careers as minority women in non-diverse fields, I want to make sure Ashby creates opportunities for the next generation of engineers from underrepresented groups.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Today, 21% of engineers at Ashby are from underrepresented groups. It’s not great, and we are taking conscious steps to improve, like sourcing diverse candidates, providing generous paid family leave, no leetcode interviews, and more.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1><strong>Interview Process</strong></h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">At Ashby, our team and interview process want to help you show your best self. We’ll dive into past projects and simulate working together via pair programming, writing product and tech specs collaboratively, and talking through decisions. There are no leetcode or whiteboard exercises.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Our interview process is three rounds:</p><ol style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Introduction call with Hiring Manager (15 to 30m, live)</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">A technical screen where we pair in our actual codebase (1h, live)</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Three non-coding interviews that focus on product thinking, technical design, and infrastructure (3h 15m, live can be split across multiple days)</p></li></ol><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Depending on our leadership team’s bandwidth, we may start with an <em>additional</em> 30m screen with a recruiter.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Your hiring manager will be your main point of contact and prep you for interviews.

            "descriptionPlain": "Hi 👋🏾 I’m Abhik https://www.linkedin.com/in/abhikpramanik/, Ashby's Co-Founder and VP of Engineering. As someone who could design and build software, this position is close to my heart. I always felt I had a unique perspective because I could play with design ideas and iterate in code. My ideas could start in Figma but then be grounded (or sometimes more creative) in code. My prototypes used actual logic and data. My changes cascaded throughout the app for comprehensive critique (thanks, React component system!). But, every company made me pick one —I couldn’t design and build. At Ashby, you can.\n\nWhile every engineer can design and build, you’ll tackle our most challenging design problems and help others improve their designs by expanding and enhancing our in-house design system and consulting on bespoke work. To ground it with examples, engineers who can design at Ashby have:\n\n - Redesigned our mobile web app by talking with customers who use it often, wireframing new flows, implementing its design system, and using it to make the wireframes a reality.\n\n - Built a set of flexible, composable components in our design system that allow other engineers to build custom autocompletes. These autocompletes can contain filters, options to create new records, etc.\n\n - Helped another engineer improve their design's information hierarchy and scannability for viewing a candidate’s assessments. Recruiters can quickly parse information and pick out anomalies.\n\nThese projects reflect what we’re accomplishing at Ashby: improving the productivity of working professionals (starting with talent teams) with intelligent and powerful software. We put a lot of effort into designing products that are approachable to beginners but mastered & extended by power users. In many ways, spreadsheets set the bar here.\n\nWe have notable customers like Notion, Linear, Shopify, and Snowflake. Our growth and retention metrics are best-in-class among our peers: we have tens of millions in ARR, growing >100% year over year, over 2500 customers, very low churn, and many years of runway. We’ll share more details once we meet, but you now probably have a good idea as to why we're hiring for this role 😅.\n\n\nWHAT WE’RE BUILDING\n\nAs engineers, we are used to tooling that makes us better at what we do. When we started Ashby, we saw the opposite with Talent Acquisition software. Recruiting teams were leveling up how they did their work, but instead of software meeting this new standard, it held them back.\n\nScheduling a final round is an excellent example. Recruiting teams wanted to schedule candidates faster, track interviewer preparation and quality, and do it with half the headcount. A recruiter needed to manually collect availability from the candidate, identify qualified interviewers, perform “Calendar Tetris” to find who is available to interview the candidate, schedule on the earliest date possible, and make any last-minute adjustments as availability changed. They must do this while considering the interview load on each individual and whether interviewers need to be trained and shadowing others. 🥵 TA software didn’t help.\n\nAs hiring managers, we know TA is a critical function, and as engineers, we know software can do better. So, we built and continue to build Ashby to give TA teams the highest standard of tooling. Software that’s intelligent and powerful. Software that provides insights into where they’re failing and automates or simplifies many of the tasks they’re underwater with. We want other functions and departments to be jealous of what TA teams can do with Ashby, and today they often are!\n\n\nENGINEERING CULTURE\n\nOur engineering culture is motivated by Benji’s (my Co-founder and CEO) and my belief that a small, talented team, given the right environment, can build high-quality software fast (and work regular hours!). We do it through:\n\n - Minimal process with ownership over decisions normally made by product and design\n\n - Natural collaboration and deliberate communication\n\n - Investing in tools and abstractions that give us leverage\n\n - Putting effort into building a diverse team\n\n\nMINIMAL PROCESS & LOTS OF OWNERSHIP\n\nThe best engineers we’ve worked with delivered reliably magical outcomes. They took customer problems and relentlessly drove them to solutions that were not only successful but often brilliant and creative. While they did this with minimal oversight, stakeholders were never in the dark as to what was going on, and no setback was a surprise.\n\nTraditional product-development processes aren’t meant for the best engineers. Their purpose is to create consistent outcomes regardless of the engineer’s skill. But, consistency comes at the expense of an engineer’s time and freedom—both ingredients necessary to generate those magical outcomes. As a result, process stifles the best engineers and doesn’t give others the opportunity to practice the behaviors that made the best engineers the “best.”\n\nAt Ashby, we want to build an environment that encourages every engineer to be their best. So, at Ashby, every Engineer runs their project. Product Managers (and Designers) build strategy, do customer research, and hand off problem briefs to Engineers. Engineers take on the rest: they research the problem, write product specs, build wireframes, and implement their solution end-to-end. We rely on engineers, not process, to push information outward to the relevant folks (e.g., Product Managers) and pull folks in to help (e.g., Designers, Infra). It’s a new level of ownership for many engineers, but we’d rather an engineer fail a bit and coach up their skills than use process as a crutch. Not everyone succeeds in our culture, but those who do thrive.\n\n\nCOLLABORATION IS NATURAL & COMMUNICATION IS DELIBERATE\n\nOur engineering team consists of lifelong learners who are talented but also humble and kind (meet them here https://www.ashbyhq.com/team!). These attributes create an environment where collaboration happens naturally. We combine this with research, prototyping, and written proposals to see around corners and get feedback from the team across time zones. Focus time is something that we hold sacred, and, with thoughtful and deliberate communication, engineers are in <2h meetings per week (I wrote about it here https://www.ashbyhq.com/blog/company/thoughtful-communication).\n\nTo drive it home, here's a recent calendar of an engineer who has been with us for over 4 years:\n\n[https://app.ashbyhq.com/api/images/user-content/4ea5f68e-c33e-4ac9-831a-e732bee4a303/d4679311-9dba-4031-bf5e-19ce78597ab1/calendar.png]\n\nWe also meet in person at least twice a year, once as a department and once as a company. You also have a small budget to meet up with folks in your city/region.\n\n\nINCREASE LEVERAGE, NOT TEAM SIZE\n\nWe built Ashby with the quality, breadth, and depth that many customers would expect from much larger teams over larger time scales. We’ve done this through investment in:\n\n - Great developer tooling. Our CI/CD takes ~10m, and we deploy at least 15x a day. A debugger that works out of the box. Everyone on the team has contributed to our developer experience 💪🏾.\n\n - Building blocks to create powerful and customizable products fast. At the core of Ashby is a set of common components (analytics modeling and query language, policy engine, workflow engine, design system) that we constantly improve. Each improvement to a common component cascades throughout our app (short video below).\n\nHere’s an impromptu quote from Arjun in our company Slack of what it’s like to build a feature at Ashby:\n\n[https://app.ashbyhq.com/api/images/user-content/4ea5f68e-c33e-4ac9-831a-e732bee4a303/8d94727a-46d8-42a2-9627-ddcd7f822f95/arjun.png]\n\nAnd a demo of one of these building blocks:\n\n\nPUT EFFORT INTO DIVERSITY\n\nDiverse teams drive innovation and better outcomes. Having seen my mother and partner build their careers as minority women in non-diverse fields, I want to make sure Ashby creates opportunities for the next generation of engineers from underrepresented groups.\n\nToday, 21% of engineers at Ashby are from underrepresented groups. It’s not great, and we are taking conscious steps to improve, like sourcing diverse candidates, providing generous paid family leave, no leetcode interviews, and more.\n\n\nINTERVIEW PROCESS\n\nAt Ashby, our team and interview process want to help you show your best self. We’ll dive into past projects and simulate working together via pair programming, writing product and tech specs collaboratively, and talking through decisions. There are no leetcode or whiteboard exercises.\n\nOur interview process is three rounds:\n\n 1. Introduction call with Hiring Manager (15 to 30m, live)\n\n 2. A technical screen where we pair in our actual codebase (1h, live)\n\n 3. Three non-coding interviews that focus on product thinking, technical design, and infrastructure (3h 15m, live can be split across multiple days)\n\nDepending on our leadership team’s bandwidth, we may start with an additional 30m screen with a recruiter.\n\nYour hiring manager will be your main point of contact and prep you for interviews. Each round will have written guidance so you know what to expect (you’ll need minimal preparation). You’ll meet 4 to 6 people in engineering (with 5-15 minutes in each interview to ask them questions). If we don’t give an offer, we’ll provide feedback!\n\n\nYOUR FIRST THREE MONTHS AT ASHBY\n\nWe want an exceptional onboarding experience for every new hire. At Ashby, your dev environment is set up with a single script, you push your first product change on day one, and you spend the rest of your time shipping product changes that give you a tour of our codebase and best practices. The product changes increase in scope and ambiguity from simple copy changes to the delivery of a prominent, impactful feature. Your manager will do a 30, 60, and 90-day review to give feedback and calibrate on how we work together.\n\nIt’s a team effort to get you successfully onboarded; you’ll have a peer paired with you to answer questions, pair program, and check in often to see if you need help. The rest of the team will run training sessions on our culture, product, engineering process, and technical architecture.\n\n\nTECHNOLOGY STACK\n\nI’m sharing our tech stack with the caveat that we don’t require previous experience in it (but a love of typed languages is helpful 😀): TypeScript (frontend & backend), React, GraphQL API, Node.js, Postgres, Redis.\n\nWhen they joined Ashby, many of our engineers switched from other languages like Swift and Kotlin (Ben https://linkedin.com/in/benasher44/), platforms like iOS (Tom https://www.linkedin.com/in/tom-quist-0925a199/) and Windows (Sergey https://www.linkedin.com/in/sergeygalich/). We care more about fundamentals (e.g., debugging, abstractions) and how fast you learn. For folks on the team who switched, it's nice seeing changes hot reload versus waiting for XCode to compile 😅.\n\n\nBENEFITS\n\n - Competitive salary and equity.\n\n - 10-year exercise window for stock options. You shouldn’t feel pressure to purchase stock options if you leave Ashby —do it when you feel financially comfortable.\n\n - Unlimited PTO, and we will encourage you to take it.\n\n - A minimum of 12 weeks of fully paid parental leave, covered by Ashby. For folks outside the US, it may be longer to be in line with regional requirements.\n\n - Generous equipment, software, and office furniture budget. Get what you need to be happy and productive!\n\n - $100/month education budget with more expensive items (like conferences) covered with manager approval.\n\n - If you’re in the US, we offer top-tier health insurance for you and your dependents, with 100% of premiums covered by Ashby. In other countries, we provide high-quality supplemental health insurance for you and your dependents, also fully covered by us.\n\nAshby’s success hinges on hiring great people and creating an environment where we can be happy, feel challenged, and do our best work.

How do you feel about engineers writing product specs, making product decisions, and not breaking down projects into individual tickets? If that sounds exciting (even if a bit scary), read on because I’m looking for an engineering manager to help us build a different type of engineering team and culture at Ashby.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">To start, why do we need to be different? Time and again, I have witnessed engineers knowing what needs to be done yet being unable to get things done because of “the process” or because “more data is needed.” Some of the most effective projects have been <em>skunkworks </em>projects, where engineers have taken total ownership of a problem and driven it to completion. I want to normalize that at Ashby.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">When we think about how these processes came about, we realize they carry a <em>pessimistic</em> mindset. They box people into smaller roles to minimize the chance of not meeting a certain standard. At Ashby. we’re building an environment that is <em>optimistic </em>about what engineers can own and achieve and embraces the innovative engineers (and frankly, often stays out of their way).</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">To accomplish this, our engineering leaders need to think deeply about individual performance, process, and culture - not running sprint planning or driving product and technical decisions. You’ll focus on building your team, their skills to thrive with the ownership they’re given, and an environment that empowers them to do their best work consistently, with little distraction. For junior EMs we try to stay within 6 direct reports. This enables them to spend time with our teams observing, correcting, praising, and, yes, coding. We like our managers to be hands-on while also making sure they’re not on the critical path.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We’ve already gathered an<a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://www.ashbyhq.com/team\"> <u>experienced, talented, and collaborative team</u></a> of 25+ engineers. You’ll help me manage the growing team of engineers in Europe.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">In addition to working with engineers you’ll also get to work on projects yourselves. Some examples of work our engineering leaders have done:</p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Provide feedback on product and technical specs to help engineers identify where to cut scope or improve quality. You don’t make the final decisions, but you’ll influence and coach ICs to reach the right ones.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Grow engineers to the point where they can take large, loosely defined projects, and deliver them with little intervention. They still ask for help when needed - the difference is that they’re driving.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Jump into our systems and code to debug a customer issue, ship a small bug fix, or improve our developer experience. Engineering leaders at Ashby are great engineers and enjoy keeping their skills up-to-date (while staying off the critical path).</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Improve how we generate and simulate data in demo accounts. It’s a project off the critical path, but it helps you keep up-to-date on our codebase while immensely impacting the business, from Engineering to QA to Sales.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p></li></ul><h1>Why be a manager?</h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">I had two experiences early in my career that set me on my path. I had a great manager who asked tonnes of questions about the decisions I was making and coached me without me realizing it. And I had a <em>terrible</em> manager - being told to work harder after a week of 3am finishes was not what I needed as a young engineer. The stark difference between these two experiences motivated me to become a manager: I wanted every engineer I worked with to have the support I had in the best case.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Since then, as I’ve learned more, I’ve realized that I love the kind of problems I get to solve as a manager. Deeply complex problems with long-term impact both on the company and on people’s lives. One of my proudest achievements is creating a fully transparent pay system, and on the day it was revealed, everybody was happy with it. Nobody stormed out. By spending time thinking deeply about everybody’s pay and ensuring the mechanics of promotion were clear, I put the team in a place where they could see a peer was paid more than them, and it not be a problem.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Despite all this, I love being technical. I sometimes indulge myself and spend a morning writing some code to improve tests or provide better abstractions. If I couldn’t be a manager, I’d be super happy to be an IC.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">I’m looking for someone who is passionate. Passionate about both management and being technical. Someone who spots a pattern amongst their team, figures out a better way for us to operate, and then builds the automation that powers it. I introduced a new process that enables engineers to merge 30% of PRs without a human review beforehand. I also built the automation that approves these PRs. I <em>also</em> built that automation with abstractions that make it easy for the engineers to improve the automation themselves.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">It can be hard to find seasoned engineering leaders who haven’t succumbed to the status quo in some way or another. We're committed to giving all our people a total and utter lack of terrible managers, and that means we're willing to take a chance on someone early in their leadership journey who's courageous, principled, and has the drive to build themselves into a great leader who can say “Yah I know everyone is doing that, but we won't because...”</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1>Why You Should or Shouldn’t Apply</h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Engineering leadership comes in many flavors, not all of which fit our model. I thought I’d outline some things I’m looking for to help you decide if this fits what you’re looking for:</p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You love being technical</em> and can hold in-depth conversations with direct reports from infra to backend to frontend.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You enjoy management problems</em>. We want people who get <em>excited </em>about driving people to be their best, giving difficult feedback, and building systems that make this easier</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You hold your team to a high standard</em> and don’t shy away from getting into the details and giving feedback, even to the best folks on your team.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You are an excellent and empathetic communicator.</em> Facilitating change at both an individual and organization level requires understanding how to navigate the beliefs, opinions, and past experiences of engineers and figuring out how to both convince them of a new way of doing things while also leaving yourself open to feedback. </p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You know what exceptional engineers look like.</em> You’ve thought deeply about what makes them tick, how to recruit them, and how to grow folks into them. I want to see depth here, the industry often regurgitates a vanilla description, but the reality is more nuanced.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You’re good at thinking about product, business</em>, and maybe even design, but you’re not interested in calling the shots and are more interested in building a team that can make the best decisions without you.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You thrive in high-trust, high-autonomy environments</em>. We're a young startup where leaders wear multiple hats, and you'll build your own (high-speed) on-ramp through developing strong feedback loops.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><strong>Put another way, you shouldn’t apply if:</strong></p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You don’t enjoy coding or don’t find time to stay up-to-date on technology.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You’ve gotten into management because it was the only growth path available</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You want to make all the product decisions instead of empowering your team to make those calls.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You're happy with a team of engineers that are predominantly early-career, mid-career, or don't thrive with ownership or autonomy. With enough guardrails, the team can get things done.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">A staff or principal engineer to you is someone who spends most of their time project managing or doing architecture reviews.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You’re not optimistic or convinced that we can build a large engineering team that functions differently than the status quo. You think, at some size, common processes need to be implemented to ensure consistent product delivery (e.g., sprint planning, product managers writing in-depth specifications). You might not say it out loud, but you think, at some size, compromises have to be made for the sake of hiring numbers.</p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1>What We’re Building</h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Talent teams aspire to build a hiring process that identifies great candidates, moves them quickly through the interview process, and provides an excellent experience for the candidate. To accomplish this, recruiters perform thousands of daily tasks to coordinate and relay information between candidates, interviewers, and hiring managers. Teams struggle to keep up!</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Scheduling a final round is an excellent example of our customers' challenges. A recruiter needs to collect availability from the candidate, identify potential interviewers, perform “Calendar Tetris” to find who is available to interview the candidate, schedule on the earliest date possible, and perform any last-minute adjustments as availability changes. They must perform this while considering the interview load on each individual and whether interviewers need to be trained and shadowing others. 🥵</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Ashby provides talent teams with intelligent and powerful software that provides insights into where they’re failing and automates or simplifies many of the tasks they’re underwater with. We put a lot of effort into designing products that are approachable to beginners but mastered and extended by power users. In many ways, spreadsheets set the bar here.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We have many customers, great revenue growth, years of runway, and amazing investors like YCombinator, Elad Gil, and Lachy Groom.

We combine this with research, prototyping, and written proposals to see around corners and get feedback from the team across time zones. Focus time is something that we hold sacred, and, with thoughtful and deliberate communication, engineers can focus 36h out of a 40h work week (Abhik wrote about it <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://www.ashbyhq.com/blog/company/thoughtful-communication\"><u>here</u></a>).

            "descriptionPlain": "Hi 👋 I’m Colin https://uk.linkedin.com/in/colinhoweuk, Director of Engineering, Europe. How do you feel about engineers writing product specs, making product decisions, and not breaking down projects into individual tickets? If that sounds exciting (even if a bit scary), read on because I’m looking for an engineering manager to help us build a different type of engineering team and culture at Ashby.\n\nTo start, why do we need to be different? Time and again, I have witnessed engineers knowing what needs to be done yet being unable to get things done because of “the process” or because “more data is needed.” Some of the most effective projects have been skunkworks projects, where engineers have taken total ownership of a problem and driven it to completion. I want to normalize that at Ashby.\n\nWhen we think about how these processes came about, we realize they carry a pessimistic mindset. They box people into smaller roles to minimize the chance of not meeting a certain standard. At Ashby. we’re building an environment that is optimistic about what engineers can own and achieve and embraces the innovative engineers (and frankly, often stays out of their way).\n\nTo accomplish this, our engineering leaders need to think deeply about individual performance, process, and culture - not running sprint planning or driving product and technical decisions. You’ll focus on building your team, their skills to thrive with the ownership they’re given, and an environment that empowers them to do their best work consistently, with little distraction. For junior EMs we try to stay within 6 direct reports. This enables them to spend time with our teams observing, correcting, praising, and, yes, coding. We like our managers to be hands-on while also making sure they’re not on the critical path.\n\nWe’ve already gathered an experienced, talented, and collaborative team https://www.ashbyhq.com/team of 25+ engineers. You’ll help me manage the growing team of engineers in Europe.\n\nIn addition to working with engineers you’ll also get to work on projects yourselves. Some examples of work our engineering leaders have done:\n\n - Provide feedback on product and technical specs to help engineers identify where to cut scope or improve quality. You don’t make the final decisions, but you’ll influence and coach ICs to reach the right ones.\n\n - Grow engineers to the point where they can take large, loosely defined projects, and deliver them with little intervention. They still ask for help when needed - the difference is that they’re driving.\n\n - Jump into our systems and code to debug a customer issue, ship a small bug fix, or improve our developer experience. Engineering leaders at Ashby are great engineers and enjoy keeping their skills up-to-date (while staying off the critical path).\n\n - Improve how we generate and simulate data in demo accounts. It’s a project off the critical path, but it helps you keep up-to-date on our codebase while immensely impacting the business, from Engineering to QA to Sales.\n\n\nWHY BE A MANAGER?\n\nI had two experiences early in my career that set me on my path.

            "descriptionHtml": "<p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Hi 👋 I’m <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://uk.linkedin.com/in/colinhoweuk\"><u>Colin</u></a>, Director of Engineering, Europe. How do you feel about engineers writing product specs, making product decisions, and not breaking down projects into individual tickets? If that sounds exciting (even if a bit scary), read on because I’m looking for an engineering manager to help us build a different type of engineering team and culture at Ashby.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">To start, why do we need to be different? Time and again, I have witnessed engineers knowing what needs to be done yet being unable to get things done because of “the process” or because “more data is needed.” Some of the most effective projects have been <em>skunkworks </em>projects, where engineers have taken total ownership of a problem and driven it to completion. I want to normalize that at Ashby.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">When we think about how these processes came about, we realize they carry a <em>pessimistic</em> mindset. They box people into smaller roles to minimize the chance of not meeting a certain standard. At Ashby. we’re building an environment that is <em>optimistic </em>about what engineers can own and achieve and embraces the innovative engineers (and frankly, often stays out of their way).</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">To accomplish this, our engineering leaders need to think deeply about individual performance, process, and culture - not running sprint planning or driving product and technical decisions. You’ll focus on building your team, their skills to thrive with the ownership they’re given, and an environment that empowers them to do their best work consistently, with little distraction. For junior EMs we try to stay within 6 direct reports. This enables them to spend time with our teams observing, correcting, praising, and, yes, coding. We like our managers to be hands-on while also making sure they’re not on the critical path.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We’ve already gathered an<a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://www.ashbyhq.com/team\"> <u>experienced, talented, and collaborative team</u></a> of 25+ engineers. You’ll help me manage the growing team of engineers in Europe.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">In addition to working with engineers you’ll also get to work on projects yourselves. Some examples of work our engineering leaders have done:</p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Provide feedback on product and technical specs to help engineers identify where to cut scope or improve quality. You don’t make the final decisions, but you’ll influence and coach ICs to reach the right ones.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Grow engineers to the point where they can take large, loosely defined projects, and deliver them with little intervention. They still ask for help when needed - the difference is that they’re driving.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Jump into our systems and code to debug a customer issue, ship a small bug fix, or improve our developer experience. Engineering leaders at Ashby are great engineers and enjoy keeping their skills up-to-date (while staying off the critical path).</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Improve how we generate and simulate data in demo accounts. It’s a project off the critical path, but it helps you keep up-to-date on our codebase while immensely impacting the business, from Engineering to QA to Sales.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p></li></ul><h1>Why be a manager?</h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">I had two experiences early in my career that set me on my path. I had a great manager who asked tonnes of questions about the decisions I was making and coached me without me realizing it. And I had a <em>terrible</em> manager - being told to work harder after a week of 3am finishes was not what I needed as a young engineer. The stark difference between these two experiences motivated me to become a manager: I wanted every engineer I worked with to have the support I had in the best case.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Since then, as I’ve learned more, I’ve realized that I love the kind of problems I get to solve as a manager. Deeply complex problems with long-term impact both on the company and on people’s lives. One of my proudest achievements is creating a fully transparent pay system, and on the day it was revealed, everybody was happy with it. Nobody stormed out. By spending time thinking deeply about everybody’s pay and ensuring the mechanics of promotion were clear, I put the team in a place where they could see a peer was paid more than them, and it not be a problem.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Despite all this, I love being technical. I sometimes indulge myself and spend a morning writing some code to improve tests or provide better abstractions. If I couldn’t be a manager, I’d be super happy to be an IC.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">I’m looking for someone who is passionate. Passionate about both management and being technical. Someone who spots a pattern amongst their team, figures out a better way for us to operate, and then builds the automation that powers it. I introduced a new process that enables engineers to merge 30% of PRs without a human review beforehand. I also built the automation that approves these PRs. I <em>also</em> built that automation with abstractions that make it easy for the engineers to improve the automation themselves.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">It can be hard to find seasoned engineering leaders who haven’t succumbed to the status quo in some way or another. We're committed to giving all our people a total and utter lack of terrible managers, and that means we're willing to take a chance on someone early in their leadership journey who's courageous, principled, and has the drive to build themselves into a great leader who can say “Yah I know everyone is doing that, but we won't because...”</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1>Why You Should or Shouldn’t Apply</h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Engineering leadership comes in many flavors, not all of which fit our model. I thought I’d outline some things I’m looking for to help you decide if this fits what you’re looking for:</p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You love being technical</em> and can hold in-depth conversations with direct reports from infra to backend to frontend.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You enjoy management problems</em>. We want people who get <em>excited </em>about driving people to be their best, giving difficult feedback, and building systems that make this easier</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You hold your team to a high standard</em> and don’t shy away from getting into the details and giving feedback, even to the best folks on your team.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You are an excellent and empathetic communicator.</em> Facilitating change at both an individual and organization level requires understanding how to navigate the beliefs, opinions, and past experiences of engineers and figuring out how to both convince them of a new way of doing things while also leaving yourself open to feedback. </p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You know what exceptional engineers look like.</em> You’ve thought deeply about what makes them tick, how to recruit them, and how to grow folks into them.

To accomplish this, recruiters perform thousands of daily tasks to coordinate and relay information between candidates, interviewers, and hiring managers. Teams struggle to keep up!</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Scheduling a final round is an excellent example of our customers' challenges. A recruiter needs to collect availability from the candidate, identify potential interviewers, perform “Calendar Tetris” to find who is available to interview the candidate, schedule on the earliest date possible, and perform any last-minute adjustments as availability changes. They must perform this while considering the interview load on each individual and whether interviewers need to be trained and shadowing others. 🥵</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Ashby provides talent teams with intelligent and powerful software that provides insights into where they’re failing and automates or simplifies many of the tasks they’re underwater with. We put a lot of effort into designing products that are approachable to beginners but mastered and extended by power users. In many ways, spreadsheets set the bar here.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We have many customers, great revenue growth, years of runway, and amazing investors like YCombinator, Elad Gil, and Lachy Groom.

These attributes create an environment where collaboration happens naturally (we filter for it in interviews). We combine this with research, prototyping, and written proposals to see around corners and get feedback from the team across time zones. Focus time is something that we hold sacred, and, with thoughtful and deliberate communication, engineers can focus 36h out of a 40h work week (Abhik wrote about it <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://www.ashbyhq.com/blog/company/thoughtful-communication\"><u>here</u></a>).

            "descriptionPlain": "Hi 👋 I’m Colin https://uk.linkedin.com/in/colinhoweuk, Director of Engineering, Europe. How do you feel about engineers writing product specs, making product decisions, and not breaking down projects into individual tickets? If that sounds exciting (even if a bit scary), read on because I’m looking for an engineering manager to help us build a different type of engineering team and culture at Ashby.\n\nTo start, why do we need to be different? Time and again, I have witnessed engineers knowing what needs to be done yet being unable to get things done because of “the process” or because “more data is needed.” Some of the most effective projects have been skunkworks projects, where engineers have taken total ownership of a problem and driven it to completion. I want to normalize that at Ashby.\n\nWhen we think about how these processes came about, we realize they carry a pessimistic mindset. They box people into smaller roles to minimize the chance of not meeting a certain standard. At Ashby. we’re building an environment that is optimistic about what engineers can own and achieve and embraces the innovative engineers (and frankly, often stays out of their way).\n\nTo accomplish this, our engineering leaders need to think deeply about individual performance, process, and culture - not running sprint planning or driving product and technical decisions. You’ll focus on building your team, their skills to thrive with the ownership they’re given, and an environment that empowers them to do their best work consistently, with little distraction. For junior EMs we try to stay within 6 direct reports. This enables them to spend time with our teams observing, correcting, praising, and, yes, coding. We like our managers to be hands-on while also making sure they’re not on the critical path.\n\nWe’ve already gathered an experienced, talented, and collaborative team https://www.ashbyhq.com/team of 25+ engineers. You’ll help me manage the growing team of engineers in Europe.\n\nIn addition to working with engineers you’ll also get to work on projects yourselves. Some examples of work our engineering leaders have done:\n\n - Provide feedback on product and technical specs to help engineers identify where to cut scope or improve quality. You don’t make the final decisions, but you’ll influence and coach ICs to reach the right ones.\n\n - Grow engineers to the point where they can take large, loosely defined projects, and deliver them with little intervention. They still ask for help when needed - the difference is that they’re driving.\n\n - Jump into our systems and code to debug a customer issue, ship a small bug fix, or improve our developer experience. Engineering leaders at Ashby are great engineers and enjoy keeping their skills up-to-date (while staying off the critical path).\n\n - Improve how we generate and simulate data in demo accounts. It’s a project off the critical path, but it helps you keep up-to-date on our codebase while immensely impacting the business, from Engineering to QA to Sales.\n\n\nWHY BE A MANAGER?\n\nI had two experiences early in my career that set me on my path. I had a great manager who asked tonnes of questions about the decisions I was making and coached me without me realizing it. And I had a terrible manager - being told to work harder after a week of 3am finishes was not what I needed as a young engineer. The stark difference between these two experiences motivated me to become a manager: I wanted every engineer I worked with to have the support I had in the best case.\n\nSince then, as I’ve learned more, I’ve realized that I love the kind of problems I get to solve as a manager. Deeply complex problems with long-term impact both on the company and on people’s lives. One of my proudest achievements is creating a fully transparent pay system, and on the day it was revealed, everybody was happy with it. Nobody stormed out. By spending time thinking deeply about everybody’s pay and ensuring the mechanics of promotion were clear, I put the team in a place where they could see a peer was paid more than them, and it not be a problem.\n\nDespite all this, I love being technical. I sometimes indulge myself and spend a morning writing some code to improve tests or provide better abstractions. If I couldn’t be a manager, I’d be super happy to be an IC.\n\nI’m looking for someone who is passionate. Passionate about both management and being technical. Someone who spots a pattern amongst their team, figures out a better way for us to operate, and then builds the automation that powers it. I introduced a new process that enables engineers to merge 30% of PRs without a human review beforehand. I also built the automation that approves these PRs. I also built that automation with abstractions that make it easy for the engineers to improve the automation themselves.\n\nIt can be hard to find seasoned engineering leaders who haven’t succumbed to the status quo in some way or another. We're committed to giving all our people a total and utter lack of terrible managers, and that means we're willing to take a chance on someone early in their leadership journey who's courageous, principled, and has the drive to build themselves into a great leader who can say “Yah I know everyone is doing that, but we won't because...”\n\n\nWHY YOU SHOULD OR SHOULDN’T APPLY\n\nEngineering leadership comes in many flavors, not all of which fit our model. I thought I’d outline some things I’m looking for to help you decide if this fits what you’re looking for:\n\n - You love being technical and can hold in-depth conversations with direct reports from infra to backend to frontend.\n\n - You enjoy management problems. We want people who get excited about driving people to be their best, giving difficult feedback, and building systems that make this easier\n\n - You hold your team to a high standard and don’t shy away from getting into the details and giving feedback, even to the best folks on your team.\n\n - You are an excellent and empathetic communicator. Facilitating change at both an individual and organization level requires understanding how to navigate the beliefs, opinions, and past experiences of engineers and figuring out how to both convince them of a new way of doing things while also leaving yourself open to feedback.\n\n - You know what exceptional engineers look like. You’ve thought deeply about what makes them tick, how to recruit them, and how to grow folks into them. I want to see depth here, the industry often regurgitates a vanilla description, but the reality is more nuanced.\n\n - You’re good at thinking about product, business, and maybe even design, but you’re not interested in calling the shots and are more interested in building a team that can make the best decisions without you.\n\n - You thrive in high-trust, high-autonomy environments. We're a young startup where leaders wear multiple hats, and you'll build your own (high-speed) on-ramp through developing strong feedback loops.\n\nPut another way, you shouldn’t apply if:\n\n - You don’t enjoy coding or don’t find time to stay up-to-date on technology.\n\n - You’ve gotten into management because it was the only growth path available\n\n - You want to make all the product decisions instead of empowering your team to make those calls.\n\n - You're happy with a team of engineers that are predominantly early-career, mid-career, or don't thrive with ownership or autonomy. With enough guardrails, the team can get things done.\n\n - A staff or principal engineer to you is someone who spends most of their time project managing or doing architecture reviews.\n\n - You’re not optimistic or convinced that we can build a large engineering team that functions differently than the status quo. You think, at some size, common processes need to be implemented to ensure consistent product delivery (e.g., sprint planning, product managers writing in-depth specifications). You might not say it out loud, but you think, at some size, compromises have to be made for the sake of hiring numbers.\n\n\nWHAT WE’RE BUILDING\n\nTalent teams aspire to build a hiring process that identifies great candidates, moves them quickly through the interview process, and provides an excellent experience for the candidate. To accomplish this, recruiters perform thousands of daily tasks to coordinate and relay information between candidates, interviewers, and hiring managers. Teams struggle to keep up!\n\nScheduling a final round is an excellent example of our customers' challenges.

We’ll share more details once we meet, but you now probably have a good idea as to why we're hiring for this role 😅.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We’ve listed this role twice: as a Platform Engineer and Site Reliability Engineer – our team does both, and we are open to candidates who lean towards one or the other. </p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1>About the role and how we work</h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Hi 👋 I’m<a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://uk.linkedin.com/in/colinhoweuk\"> <u>Colin</u></a>, Head of EMEA Engineering. I’ve spent a number of years leading engineering teams in startups, and that has always included being close to infrastructure teams - no matter what name they’ve worn (SRE, infrastructure, platform, etc). I’ve got my hands dirty building the initial infrastructure for startups and know the value a talented infrastructure engineer brings. The rigour, the discipline, the peace and quiet when everything just <em>hums along</em>.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Our infrastructure is in a good place <em>for now</em>. Nothing is static. Ashby continues to grow rapidly, putting strain on our existing infrastructure. We’re always looking to give our customers more powerful hiring software, and building new product features often requires new pieces of infrastructure.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Having herded plenty of <em>snowflakeservers</em> in the past, I’ve learned there’s a better way. I (and Ashby) place a lot of value on infrastructure-as-code. As a Platform Engineer at Ashby, you’ll get to dive into scaling problems, add new capabilities to our platform, and think about how our entire team interacts with infrastructure. All our own engineers own their projects end-to-end and ship with minimal oversight. We don’t put roadblocks to ensure security when common sense will do and we don’t build processes like change management boards around the lowest common denominator. But with great power comes great responsibility: we handle personal and confidential data about some of the biggest decisions we ever make at work. As we grow, more and bigger customers rely on us to be reliable and secure and how we operate internally will need to evolve.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We’re at an inflection point where our ability to scale and deliver a seamless experience has a make-or-break impact – we have some of the fastest growing companies using our platform every day to hire hundreds of people per month. We need someone like you to make good decisions, debug thorny issues, and build us a future-proof platform that can withstand this scale. Our small but mighty infrastructure team has set up a secure and simple environment (we don’t believe in spinning up a new service unless necessary!) for our growing product team to build in. That’s where you come in: you, too, will own projects end-to-end and have an impact on core parts of the Ashby developer and user experience.

You only want to work with people who make you better, and want to make you better.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You’ve built infrastructure at a slightly later stage than Ashby is at - you know how to deal with millions of data points, have seen great (or not great) infrastructure make or break customer experience, and have automated everything from provisioning to monitoring and release process.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You’re a Swiss army knife (all nationalities welcome ;) ). You’ll get every hard problem the company faces. You’ll get to do infrastructure updates, security enforcements, database optimization, Kubernetes debugging, and digging through Typescript traces figuring out what doesn’t work. You probably don’t feel like an expert at at least some of that... and that appeals to you.</p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">All that makes for a pretty specific kind of role, and the job isn’t to everyone’s tastes! You should not apply if:</p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You don’t want to make your own decisions on what is the best paved road to build for Ashby, and expect a lead or manager to make the final call on what that is. Our leads (and managers) give ample commentary and feedback on technical decisions and how they’re made, but you ship what you want to build and are accountable for it.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You hate SQL. We have a lot of features built around making the best out of data, and our platform engineers also sometimes dive into a gnarly report or advise engineers on a more performant data model to use.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You don’t want to code. Our SREs are some of our best software engineers and they are just as responsible for the application as the other engineering teams - albeit at a platform level. Reviewing code and submitting code changes will be part of your day to day.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Your primary mode of communicating best practices to engineers is live meetings. We’re a very async culture and written communication (and code) is how changes get made. As an Ashby SRE, you will need to share new tooling and best practices with engineers faster than your next meeting opportunity will take you.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You’ve never delivered a project, on your own, without someone prodding you for updates. We have no project or delivery managers to fill your calendar with busy work, but the flip side is you have to do your project management, seek the help you need to get unstuck and cut scope when it’s worthwhile.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p></li></ul><h1>Technology Stack</h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">I’m sharing our tech stack with the caveat that we don’t require previous experience in it: TypeScript (frontend &amp; backend), Node.js, React, Apollo GraphQL, Postgres, Redis.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We use Datadog and Sentry on 100% cloud-based (AWS) infra. We take developer experience and reliability seriously: all engineers are on call in a follow-the-sun model, and everyone contributes to developer tooling.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1>What We’re Building</h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">As engineers, we are used to tooling that makes us <strong>better</strong> at what we do. When we started Ashby, we saw the opposite with Talent Acquisition software. Recruiting teams were leveling up how they did their work, but instead of software meeting this new standard, it held them back.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Scheduling a final round is an excellent example. Recruiting teams wanted to schedule candidates faster, track interviewer preparation and quality, and do it with half the headcount. A recruiter needed to manually collect availability from the candidate, identify qualified interviewers, perform “Calendar Tetris” to find who is available to interview the candidate, schedule on the earliest date possible, and make any last-minute adjustments as availability changed. They must do this while considering the interview load on each individual and whether interviewers need to be trained and shadowing others. 🥵 TA software didn’t help.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">As hiring managers, we know TA is a critical function, and as engineers, we know software can do better. So, we built and continue to build Ashby to give TA teams the <em>highest</em> standard of tooling. Software that’s intelligent and powerful. Software that provides insights into where they’re failing and automates or simplifies many of the tasks they’re underwater with. We want other functions and departments to be jealous of what TA teams can do with Ashby, and today they often are!</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1>Engineering Culture</h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Our engineering culture is motivated by <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/abhikpramanik/\"><u>Abhik</u></a> and <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/benjaminencz/\"><u>Benji</u></a>’s (our co-founders) belief that a small talented team, given the right environment, can build high-quality software fast (and work regular hours!). We do it through:</p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Minimal process with ownership over decisions normally made by product and design</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Natural collaboration and deliberate communication</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Investing in tools and abstractions that give us leverage</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Putting effort into building a diverse team</p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h2><strong>Minimal Process &amp; Lots of Ownership</strong></h2><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">The best engineers we’ve worked with delivered reliably magical outcomes. They took customer problems and relentlessly drove them to solutions that were not only successful but often brilliant and creative. While they did this with minimal oversight, stakeholders were never in the dark as to what was going on, and no setback was a surprise.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Traditional product-development processes aren’t meant for the best engineers. Their purpose is to create consistent outcomes regardless of the engineer’s skill. But, consistency comes at the expense of an engineer’s time and freedom—both ingredients necessary to generate those magical outcomes. As a result, process stifles the best engineers and doesn’t give others the opportunity to practice the behaviors that made the best engineers the “best.”</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">At Ashby, we want to build an environment that encourages every engineer to be their best. So, at Ashby, every Engineer runs their project. Product Managers (and Designers) build strategy, do customer research, and hand off problem briefs to Engineers. Engineers take on the rest: they research the problem, write product specs, build wireframes, and implement their solution end-to-end. We rely on engineers, not process, to push information outward to the relevant folks (e.g., Product Managers) and pull folks in to help (e.g., Designers, Infra). It’s a new level of ownership for many engineers, but we’d rather an engineer fail a bit and coach up their skills than use process as a crutch. Not everyone succeeds in our culture, but those who do <em>thrive</em>.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h2><strong>Collaboration is Natural &amp; Communication is Deliberate</strong></h2><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Our engineering team consists of lifelong learners who are talented but also humble and kind (meet them <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://www.ashbyhq.com/team\"><u>here</u></a>!). These attributes create an environment where collaboration happens naturally. We combine this with research, prototyping, and written proposals to see around corners and get feedback from the team across time zones. Focus time is something that we hold sacred, and, with thoughtful and deliberate communication, engineers are in &lt;2h meetings per week (Abhik wrote about it <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://www.ashbyhq.com/blog/company/thoughtful-communication\"><u>here</u></a>).</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">To drive it home, here's a recent calendar of an engineer who has been with us for over 4 years:</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><div style=\"text-align:left\"><img style=\"max-width:100%\" src=\"https://app.ashbyhq.com/api/images/user-content/4ea5f68e-c33e-4ac9-831a-e732bee4a303/d4679311-9dba-4031-bf5e-19ce78597ab1/calendar.png\" /></div><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We also meet in person at least twice a year, once as a department and once as a company. You also have a small budget to meet up with folks in your city/region.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h2><strong>Increase Leverage, not Team Size</strong></h2><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We built Ashby with the quality, breadth, and depth that many customers would expect from much larger teams over larger time scales. We’ve done this through investment in:</p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><strong>Great developer tooling.</strong> Our CI/CD takes ~10m, and we deploy at least 15x a day. A debugger that works out of the box. Everyone on the team has contributed to our developer experience 💪🏾.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><strong>Building blocks to create powerful and customizable products fast.</strong> At the core of Ashby is a set of common components (analytics modeling and query language, policy engine, workflow engine, design system) that we constantly improve. Each improvement to a common component cascades throughout our app (short video below).</p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Here’s an impromptu quote from Arjun in our company Slack of what it’s like to build a feature at Ashby:</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><div style=\"text-align:left\"><img style=\"max-width:100%\" src=\"https://app.ashbyhq.com/api/images/user-content/4ea5f68e-c33e-4ac9-831a-e732bee4a303/8d94727a-46d8-42a2-9627-ddcd7f822f95/arjun.png\" /></div><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">And a demo of one of these building blocks:</p><div><div style=\"left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:62.5%\"><iframe src=\"https://embedded-media.ashbyhq.com/embed/4ea5f68e-c33e-4ac9-831a-e732bee4a303/9a5f032d-c731-411e-98cf-261517156f01\" style=\"top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0\" allowfullscreen scrolling=\"no\" allow=\"encrypted-media *; picture-in-picture *;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-presentation\"></iframe></div></div><h2><strong>Put Effort into Diversity</strong></h2><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Diverse teams drive innovation and better outcomes. Having seen my mother and partner build their careers as minority women in non-diverse fields, I want to make sure Ashby creates opportunities for the next generation of engineers from underrepresented groups.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Today, 21% of engineers at Ashby are from underrepresented groups. It’s not great, and we are taking conscious steps to improve, like sourcing diverse candidates, providing generous paid family leave, no leetcode interviews, and more.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1>Interview Process</h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">At Ashby, our team and interview process want to help you show your best self. We’ll dive into past projects and simulate working together via pair programming, writing product and tech specs collaboratively, and talking through decisions. There are no leetcode or whiteboard exercises.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Our interview process is three rounds:</p><ol style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Introduction call with Hiring Manager (15 to 30m, live)</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">A technical screen where we pair in our actual codebase (1h, live)</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Three non-coding interviews that focus on technical design, debugging incidents, and infrastructure (3h 15m, live can be split across multiple days)</p></li></ol><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Depending on our leadership team’s bandwidth, we may start with an <em>additional</em> 30m screen with a recruiter.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Your hiring manager will be your main point of contact and prep you for interviews. Each round will have written guidance so you know what to expect (you’ll need minimal preparation). You’ll meet 4 to 6 people in engineering (with 5-15 minutes in each interview to ask them questions). If we don’t give an offer, we’ll provide feedback!</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1><strong>Your First Three Months at Ashby</strong></h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We want an exceptional onboarding experience for every new hire. At Ashby, your dev environment is set up with a single script, you push your first product change on day one, and you spend the rest of your time shipping product changes that give you a tour of our codebase and best practices. The product changes increase in scope and ambiguity from simple copy changes to the delivery of a prominent, impactful feature. Your manager will do a 30, 60, and 90-day review to give feedback and calibrate on how we work together.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">It’s a team effort to get you successfully onboarded; you’ll have a peer paired with you to answer questions, pair program, and check in often to see if you need help. The rest of the team will run training sessions on our culture, product, engineering process, and technical architecture.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1>Benefits</h1><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Competitive salary and equity.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">10-year exercise window for stock options. You shouldn’t feel pressure to purchase stock options if you leave Ashby —do it when you feel financially comfortable.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Unlimited PTO, and we will encourage you to take it.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">A minimum of 12 weeks of fully paid parental leave, covered by Ashby. For folks outside the US, it may be longer to be in line with regional requirements.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Generous equipment, software, and office furniture budget. Get what you need to be happy and productive!</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">$100/month education budget with more expensive items (like conferences) covered with manager approval.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">If you’re in the US, we offer top-tier health insurance for you and your dependents, with 100% of premiums covered by Ashby. In other countries, we provide high-quality supplemental health insurance for you and your dependents, also fully covered by us.</p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Ashby’s success hinges on hiring great people and creating an environment where we can be happy, feel challenged, and do our best work. We’re being deliberate about building that environment from the ground up. I hope that excites you enough to apply.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>Ashby provides equal employment opportunities (EEO) to all employees and applicants for employment without regard to race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability, genetics, sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression.

While they did this with minimal oversight, stakeholders were never in the dark as to what was going on, and no setback was a surprise.\n\nTraditional product-development processes aren’t meant for the best engineers. Their purpose is to create consistent outcomes regardless of the engineer’s skill. But, consistency comes at the expense of an engineer’s time and freedom—both ingredients necessary to generate those magical outcomes. As a result, process stifles the best engineers and doesn’t give others the opportunity to practice the behaviors that made the best engineers the “best.”\n\nAt Ashby, we want to build an environment that encourages every engineer to be their best. So, at Ashby, every Engineer runs their project. Product Managers (and Designers) build strategy, do customer research, and hand off problem briefs to Engineers. Engineers take on the rest: they research the problem, write product specs, build wireframes, and implement their solution end-to-end. We rely on engineers, not process, to push information outward to the relevant folks (e.g., Product Managers) and pull folks in to help (e.g., Designers, Infra). It’s a new level of ownership for many engineers, but we’d rather an engineer fail a bit and coach up their skills than use process as a crutch. Not everyone succeeds in our culture, but those who do thrive.\n\n\nCOLLABORATION IS NATURAL & COMMUNICATION IS DELIBERATE\n\nOur engineering team consists of lifelong learners who are talented but also humble and kind (meet them here https://www.ashbyhq.com/team!). These attributes create an environment where collaboration happens naturally. We combine this with research, prototyping, and written proposals to see around corners and get feedback from the team across time zones. Focus time is something that we hold sacred, and, with thoughtful and deliberate communication, engineers are in <2h meetings per week (Abhik wrote about it here https://www.ashbyhq.com/blog/company/thoughtful-communication).\n\nTo drive it home, here's a recent calendar of an engineer who has been with us for over 4 years:\n\n[https://app.ashbyhq.com/api/images/user-content/4ea5f68e-c33e-4ac9-831a-e732bee4a303/d4679311-9dba-4031-bf5e-19ce78597ab1/calendar.png]\n\nWe also meet in person at least twice a year, once as a department and once as a company. You also have a small budget to meet up with folks in your city/region.\n\n\nINCREASE LEVERAGE, NOT TEAM SIZE\n\nWe built Ashby with the quality, breadth, and depth that many customers would expect from much larger teams over larger time scales. We’ve done this through investment in:\n\n - Great developer tooling. Our CI/CD takes ~10m, and we deploy at least 15x a day. A debugger that works out of the box. Everyone on the team has contributed to our developer experience 💪🏾.\n\n - Building blocks to create powerful and customizable products fast. At the core of Ashby is a set of common components (analytics modeling and query language, policy engine, workflow engine, design system) that we constantly improve. Each improvement to a common component cascades throughout our app (short video below).\n\nHere’s an impromptu quote from Arjun in our company Slack of what it’s like to build a feature at Ashby:\n\n[https://app.ashbyhq.com/api/images/user-content/4ea5f68e-c33e-4ac9-831a-e732bee4a303/8d94727a-46d8-42a2-9627-ddcd7f822f95/arjun.png]\n\nAnd a demo of one of these building blocks:\n\n\nPUT EFFORT INTO DIVERSITY\n\nDiverse teams drive innovation and better outcomes. Having seen my mother and partner build their careers as minority women in non-diverse fields, I want to make sure Ashby creates opportunities for the next generation of engineers from underrepresented groups.\n\nToday, 21% of engineers at Ashby are from underrepresented groups. It’s not great, and we are taking conscious steps to improve, like sourcing diverse candidates, providing generous paid family leave, no leetcode interviews, and more.\n\n\nINTERVIEW PROCESS\n\nAt Ashby, our team and interview process want to help you show your best self. We’ll dive into past projects and simulate working together via pair programming, writing product and tech specs collaboratively, and talking through decisions. There are no leetcode or whiteboard exercises.\n\nOur interview process is three rounds:\n\n 1. Introduction call with Hiring Manager (15 to 30m, live)\n\n 2. A technical screen where we pair in our actual codebase (1h, live)\n\n 3. Three non-coding interviews that focus on technical design, debugging incidents, and infrastructure (3h 15m, live can be split across multiple days)\n\nDepending on our leadership team’s bandwidth, we may start with an additional 30m screen with a recruiter.\n\nYour hiring manager will be your main point of contact and prep you for interviews. Each round will have written guidance so you know what to expect (you’ll need minimal preparation). You’ll meet 4 to 6 people in engineering (with 5-15 minutes in each interview to ask them questions). If we don’t give an offer, we’ll provide feedback!\n\n\nYOUR FIRST THREE MONTHS AT ASHBY\n\nWe want an exceptional onboarding experience for every new hire. At Ashby, your dev environment is set up with a single script, you push your first product change on day one, and you spend the rest of your time shipping product changes that give you a tour of our codebase and best practices. The product changes increase in scope and ambiguity from simple copy changes to the delivery of a prominent, impactful feature. Your manager will do a 30, 60, and 90-day review to give feedback and calibrate on how we work together.\n\nIt’s a team effort to get you successfully onboarded; you’ll have a peer paired with you to answer questions, pair program, and check in often to see if you need help. The rest of the team will run training sessions on our culture, product, engineering process, and technical architecture.\n\n\nBENEFITS\n\n - Competitive salary and equity.\n\n - 10-year exercise window for stock options. You shouldn’t feel pressure to purchase stock options if you leave Ashby —do it when you feel financially comfortable.\n\n - Unlimited PTO, and we will encourage you to take it.\n\n - A minimum of 12 weeks of fully paid parental leave, covered by Ashby. For folks outside the US, it may be longer to be in line with regional requirements.\n\n - Generous equipment, software, and office furniture budget. Get what you need to be happy and productive!\n\n - $100/month education budget with more expensive items (like conferences) covered with manager approval.\n\n - If you’re in the US, we offer top-tier health insurance for you and your dependents, with 100% of premiums covered by Ashby. In other countries, we provide high-quality supplemental health insurance for you and your dependents, also fully covered by us.\n\nAshby’s success hinges on hiring great people and creating an environment where we can be happy, feel challenged, and do our best work. We’re being deliberate about building that environment from the ground up. I hope that excites you enough to apply.\n\nAshby provides equal employment opportunities (EEO) to all employees and applicants for employment without regard to race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability, genetics, sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression.

            "descriptionHtml": "<p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Hi 👋🏾 I’m <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/abhikpramanik\"><u>Abhik</u></a>, Ashby's Co-Founder and VP of Engineering. We’re looking for an ambitious full-stack engineer who is laser-focused on solving customer problems and making the right long-term investments to solve them not only today but in our future features and products.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">What Ashby gives you in return is the best of both early and growth-stage environments. The agency and no-nonsense of a seed startup: you write product specs, make product and design decisions, and build in an almost-no-meeting culture. While also the product-market fit and scale of a growth-stage startup: tens of thousands of daily users who depend on your software and eagerly await your next feature.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We have notable customers like Notion, Linear, Shopify, and Snowflake. Our growth and retention metrics are best-in-class among our peers: we have tens of millions in ARR, growing &gt;100% year over year, very low churn, and many years of runway. We’ll share more details once we meet.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You’ve probably seen this role posted before, and it’s because we’re always expanding the team (we’re on track to double this year). We’re bubbling with ideas on how to support Talent Acquisition through software, and we’ve started the journey of building products beyond Talent Acquisition. We read every application and aim to respond to yours within 3-4 days (often sooner).</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1>About the Role and How We Work</h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Our engineering culture strives to recreate the environments where we did our best work as ICs – where we had the ownership and agency to impact our users with creative and innovative software.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">I started my career building software for artists in the Visual Effects industry. It was a formative experience for me as a software engineer because success relied on my ability to be a product manager and designer. I talked to artists to understand their needs. I came up with ideas. I did industry research, designed interfaces, and prototyped ideas. I watched artists use what I built and decided what to tackle in the next iteration. No daily stand-ups, no t-shirt sizing, no planning meetings.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">I studied computer science to solve problems, not tickets, and this felt exactly like that. I not only felt creative and fulfilled but the agency and ownership we were given as engineers powered an incredible amount of innovation.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Innovation came differently (or not at all) at technology startups beyond the seed stage, often through an engineer’s force of will and ability to push back against culture (rather than any encouragement from it). Engineering was narrowed to implementation and delivery, partly due to the influence of other departments and partly due to the influx of \"Agile\" processes like sprint planning. In those companies, I felt like a JIRA jockey. </p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">At Ashby, we’re building an environment that is optimistic about what engineers can own and achieve. An environment that embraces innovative engineers, and, frankly, often stays out of their way. As a Product Engineer, you’ll take ownership over a large portion of one of our products and own projects end-to-end (wearing hats traditionally worn by product and design). You’ll research competitors, write product specs, make wireframes, and more. To ground it with examples, product engineers at Ashby have:</p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Designed and built automated interview scheduling. This feature automates scheduling by calculating possible times from a pool of interviewers and other constraints, and then presenting these times to the candidate for selection via our responsive web app. This solves the “Calendar Tetris” problem I talk about in \"What We're Building.\"</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Built a generalized declarative filter architecture that allows users to create complex filters for any record with a consistent UI and compile it to SQL in our backend. Many user-facing features use it.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Specced, designed, and implemented a feature that allows users to complete signing offers entirely within Ashby. This project involved talking to customers to understand their requirements, deciding what technologies to use, building a prototype, and working with other team members to integrate the final implementation into additional features.</p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1>What We’re Building</h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">As engineers, we are used to tooling that makes us <strong>better</strong> at what we do. When we started Ashby, we saw the opposite with Talent Acquisition software. Recruiting teams were leveling up how they did their work, but instead of software meeting this new standard, it held them back.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Scheduling a final round is an excellent example. Recruiting teams wanted to schedule candidates faster, track interviewer preparation and quality, and do it with half the headcount. A recruiter needed to manually collect availability from the candidate, identify qualified interviewers, perform “Calendar Tetris” to find who is available to interview the candidate, schedule on the earliest date possible, and make any last-minute adjustments as availability changed. They must do this while considering the interview load on each individual and whether interviewers need to be trained and shadowing others. 🥵 TA software didn’t help.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">As hiring managers, we know TA is a critical function, and as engineers, we know software can do better. So, we built and continue to build Ashby to give TA teams the <em>highest</em> standard of tooling. Software that’s intelligent and powerful. Software that provides insights into where they’re failing and automates or simplifies many of the tasks they’re underwater with. We want other functions and departments to be jealous of what TA teams can do with Ashby, and today they often are!</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1>Why You Should or Shouldn’t Apply</h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Software engineers come in many flavors, not all of which fit our model. Here are some things  to help you decide if this fits you and what you’re looking for:</p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You’re not afraid to tackle any part of a technology stack.</em> You do what’s necessary to successfully deliver a feature, whether writing frontend or choosing new infrastructure. We’ll provide a supportive environment to do it successfully (e.g., design system, SRE team).</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You’ve tackled projects with a lot of product and technical ambiguity, and you thrive at the intersection of the two. </em>We’re not building a simple CRUD app, and many of the challenges we tackle require you to use your knowledge of our customers to build powerful abstractions and flexibility in the system to solve a class of problems.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You know how to strike the right balance between speed and quality. </em>Ashby wasn’t built quickly. We took four years to launch publicly because convincing customers to switch required a high-quality product. However, time isn’t infinite, especially for a startup, so we still move with urgency—we’ve built the equivalent of three or more VC-backed startups with a very small team.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You are ambitious and always looking to improve your skills. </em>For most engineers, this role will give you more freedom and responsibilities than you’ve experienced in the past. To thrive (and level up), you’ll need to be open to feedback (and we give lots of it).</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You’re an excellent collaborator and communicator. </em>Ownership and freedom don’t mean you work in a vacuum. You’ll need to vet your decisions with the appropriate stakeholders, keep them up to date when necessary, and work with other engineers to get your projects across the finish line. Clear and concise communication helps a lot here!</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You seek to create leverage in your work. </em>The nature of software is that you can often automate or abstract what would be tedious, time-consuming work. Your impatience usually leads to new abstractions, tools to allow Support to debug before Engineering, new lint rules to prevent common bugs, etc. </p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><strong>Put another way, you shouldn’t apply if:</strong></p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You need company-driven process and structure to get your projects across the finish line. </em>Sprint planning and well-defined project management processes are things you need or look to others to lead. You’d rather focus on the technical details and challenges.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You only want to do exciting work. </em>We’re building a team of kind, collaborative folks. Customer issues and investigations are distributed across the team, including our high-level ICs.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You can get lost in the details.</em> Once you start implementation, it can be hard to take a step back and think about the project as a whole. You like everything to be planned upfront.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You haven’t led or taken ownership of projects before.</em> You’re used to working with tech leads and taking on tasks distributed by them.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You want to mentor earlier-career engineers.</em> We rely on engineers owning their projects, so we need engineers with that experience. This requires the team to be reasonably tenured. More than 90% of the team would be considered Senior or above in the industry today, so mentorship opportunities are very limited.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>To you, a tech lead, staff, or principal engineer is someone who spends most of their time project managing or doing architecture reviews. </em>Our most tenured engineers spend most of their time building, and we often trust them with our most challenging problems. While they lead product and technical areas and help other engineers plan their most challenging work, it’s not a requirement, nor do engineers need their sign-off.</p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1>Engineering Culture</h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Our engineering culture is motivated by Benji’s (my Co-founder and CEO) and my belief that a small, talented team, given the right environment, can build high-quality software fast (and work regular hours!). We do it through:</p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Minimal process with ownership over decisions normally made by product and design</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Natural collaboration and deliberate communication</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Investing in tools and abstractions that give us leverage</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Putting effort into building a diverse team</p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h2><strong>Minimal Process &amp; Lots of Ownership</strong></h2><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">The best engineers we’ve worked with delivered reliably magical outcomes. They took customer problems and relentlessly drove them to solutions that were not only successful but often brilliant and creative. While they did this with minimal oversight, stakeholders were never in the dark as to what was going on, and no setback was a surprise.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Traditional product-development processes aren’t meant for the best engineers. Their purpose is to create consistent outcomes regardless of the engineer’s skill. But, consistency comes at the expense of an engineer’s time and freedom—both ingredients necessary to generate those magical outcomes. As a result, process stifles the best engineers and doesn’t give others the opportunity to practice the behaviors that made the best engineers the “best.”</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">At Ashby, we want to build an environment that encourages every engineer to be their best. So, at Ashby, every Engineer runs their project. Product Managers (and Designers) build strategy, do customer research, and hand off problem briefs to Engineers. Engineers take on the rest: they research the problem, write product specs, build wireframes, and implement their solution end-to-end. We rely on engineers, not process, to push information outward to the relevant folks (e.g., Product Managers) and pull folks in to help (e.g., Designers, Infra). It’s a new level of ownership for many engineers, but we’d rather an engineer fail a bit and coach up their skills than use process as a crutch. Not everyone succeeds in our culture, but those who do <em>thrive</em>.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h2><strong>Collaboration is Natural &amp; Communication is Deliberate</strong></h2><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Our engineering team consists of lifelong learners who are talented but also humble and kind (meet them <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://www.ashbyhq.com/team\"><u>here</u></a>!). These attributes create an environment where collaboration happens naturally. We combine this with research, prototyping, and written proposals to see around corners and get feedback from the team across time zones. Focus time is something that we hold sacred, and, with thoughtful and deliberate communication, engineers are in &lt;2h meetings per week (I wrote about it <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://www.ashbyhq.com/blog/company/thoughtful-communication\"><u>here</u></a>).</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">To drive it home, here's a recent calendar of an engineer who has been with us for over 4 years:</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><div style=\"text-align:left\"><img style=\"max-width:100%\" src=\"https://app.ashbyhq.com/api/images/user-content/4ea5f68e-c33e-4ac9-831a-e732bee4a303/d4679311-9dba-4031-bf5e-19ce78597ab1/calendar.png\" /></div><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We also meet in person at least twice a year, once as a department and once as a company. You also have a small budget to meet up with folks in your city/region.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h2><strong>Increase Leverage, not Team Size</strong></h2><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We built Ashby with the quality, breadth, and depth that many customers would expect from much larger teams over larger time scales. We’ve done this through investment in:</p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><strong>Great developer tooling.</strong> Our CI/CD takes ~10m, and we deploy at least 15x a day. A debugger that works out of the box. Everyone on the team has contributed to our developer experience 💪🏾.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><strong>Building blocks to create powerful and customizable products fast.</strong> At the core of Ashby is a set of common components (analytics modeling and query language, policy engine, workflow engine, design system) that we constantly improve. Each improvement to a common component cascades throughout our app (short video below).</p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Here’s an impromptu quote from Arjun in our company Slack of what it’s like to build a feature at Ashby:</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><div style=\"text-align:left\"><img style=\"max-width:100%\" src=\"https://app.ashbyhq.com/api/images/user-content/4ea5f68e-c33e-4ac9-831a-e732bee4a303/8d94727a-46d8-42a2-9627-ddcd7f822f95/arjun.png\" /></div><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">And a demo of one of these building blocks:</p><div><div style=\"left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:62.5%\"><iframe src=\"https://embedded-media.ashbyhq.com/embed/4ea5f68e-c33e-4ac9-831a-e732bee4a303/9a5f032d-c731-411e-98cf-261517156f01\" style=\"top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0\" allowfullscreen scrolling=\"no\" allow=\"encrypted-media *; picture-in-picture *;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-presentation\"></iframe></div></div><h2><strong>Put Effort into Diversity</strong></h2><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Diverse teams drive innovation and better outcomes. Having seen my mother and partner build their careers as minority women in non-diverse fields, I want to make sure Ashby creates opportunities for the next generation of engineers from underrepresented groups.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Today, 21% of engineers at Ashby are from underrepresented groups. It’s not great, and we are taking conscious steps to improve, like sourcing diverse candidates, providing generous paid family leave, no leetcode interviews, and more.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1><strong>Interview Process</strong></h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">At Ashby, our team and interview process want to help you show your best self. We’ll dive into past projects and simulate working together via pair programming, writing product and tech specs collaboratively, and talking through decisions. There are no leetcode or whiteboard exercises.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Our interview process is three rounds:</p><ol style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Introduction call with Hiring Manager (15 to 30m, live)</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">A technical screen where we pair in our actual codebase (1h, live)</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Three non-coding interviews that focus on product thinking, technical design, and infrastructure (3h 15m, live can be split across multiple days)</p></li></ol><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Depending on our leadership team’s bandwidth, we may start with an <em>additional</em> 30m screen with a recruiter.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Your hiring manager will be your main point of contact and prep you for interviews. Each round will have written guidance so you know what to expect (you’ll need minimal preparation). You’ll meet 4 to 6 people in engineering (with 5-15 minutes in each interview to ask them questions). If we don’t give an offer, we’ll provide feedback!</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1><strong>Your First Three Months at Ashby</strong></h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We want an exceptional onboarding experience for every new hire. At Ashby, your dev environment is set up with a single script, you push your first product change on day one, and you spend the rest of your time shipping product changes that give you a tour of our codebase and best practices. The product changes increase in scope and ambiguity from simple copy changes to the delivery of a prominent, impactful feature. Your manager will do a 30, 60, and 90-day review to give feedback and calibrate on how we work together.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">It’s a team effort to get you successfully onboarded; you’ll have a peer paired with you to answer questions, pair program, and check in often to see if you need help. The rest of the team will run training sessions on our culture, product, engineering process, and technical architecture.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1><strong>Technology Stack</strong></h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">I’m sharing our tech stack with the caveat that we don’t require previous experience in it (but a love of typed languages is helpful 😀): TypeScript (frontend &amp; backend), React, GraphQL API, Node.js, Postgres, Redis.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">When they joined Ashby, many of our engineers switched from other languages like Swift and Kotlin (<a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://linkedin.com/in/benasher44/\"><u>Ben</u></a>), platforms like iOS (<a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/tom-quist-0925a199/\"><u>Tom</u></a>) and Windows (<a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/sergeygalich/\"><u>Sergey</u></a>). We care more about fundamentals (e.g., debugging, abstractions) and how fast you learn. For folks on the team who switched, it's nice seeing changes hot reload versus waiting for XCode to compile 😅.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1><strong>Benefits</strong></h1><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Competitive salary and equity.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">10-year exercise window for stock options. You shouldn’t feel pressure to purchase stock options if you leave Ashby —do it when you feel financially comfortable.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Unlimited PTO, and we will encourage you to take it.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">A minimum of 12 weeks of fully paid parental leave, covered by Ashby.

            "descriptionPlain": "Hi 👋🏾 I’m Abhik https://www.linkedin.com/in/abhikpramanik, Ashby's Co-Founder and VP of Engineering. We’re looking for an ambitious full-stack engineer who is laser-focused on solving customer problems and making the right long-term investments to solve them not only today but in our future features and products.\n\nWhat Ashby gives you in return is the best of both early and growth-stage environments. The agency and no-nonsense of a seed startup: you write product specs, make product and design decisions, and build in an almost-no-meeting culture. While also the product-market fit and scale of a growth-stage startup: tens of thousands of daily users who depend on your software and eagerly await your next feature.\n\nWe have notable customers like Notion, Linear, Shopify, and Snowflake. Our growth and retention metrics are best-in-class among our peers: we have tens of millions in ARR, growing >100% year over year, very low churn, and many years of runway. We’ll share more details once we meet.\n\nYou’ve probably seen this role posted before, and it’s because we’re always expanding the team (we’re on track to double this year). We’re bubbling with ideas on how to support Talent Acquisition through software, and we’ve started the journey of building products beyond Talent Acquisition. We read every application and aim to respond to yours within 3-4 days (often sooner).\n\n\nABOUT THE ROLE AND HOW WE WORK\n\nOur engineering culture strives to recreate the environments where we did our best work as ICs – where we had the ownership and agency to impact our users with creative and innovative software.\n\nI started my career building software for artists in the Visual Effects industry. It was a formative experience for me as a software engineer because success relied on my ability to be a product manager and designer. I talked to artists to understand their needs. I came up with ideas. I did industry research, designed interfaces, and prototyped ideas. I watched artists use what I built and decided what to tackle in the next iteration. No daily stand-ups, no t-shirt sizing, no planning meetings.\n\nI studied computer science to solve problems, not tickets, and this felt exactly like that. I not only felt creative and fulfilled but the agency and ownership we were given as engineers powered an incredible amount of innovation.\n\nInnovation came differently (or not at all) at technology startups beyond the seed stage, often through an engineer’s force of will and ability to push back against culture (rather than any encouragement from it). Engineering was narrowed to implementation and delivery, partly due to the influence of other departments and partly due to the influx of \"Agile\" processes like sprint planning. In those companies, I felt like a JIRA jockey.\n\nAt Ashby, we’re building an environment that is optimistic about what engineers can own and achieve. An environment that embraces innovative engineers, and, frankly, often stays out of their way. As a Product Engineer, you’ll take ownership over a large portion of one of our products and own projects end-to-end (wearing hats traditionally worn by product and design). You’ll research competitors, write product specs, make wireframes, and more. To ground it with examples, product engineers at Ashby have:\n\n - Designed and built automated interview scheduling. This feature automates scheduling by calculating possible times from a pool of interviewers and other constraints, and then presenting these times to the candidate for selection via our responsive web app. This solves the “Calendar Tetris” problem I talk about in \"What We're Building.\"\n\n - Built a generalized declarative filter architecture that allows users to create complex filters for any record with a consistent UI and compile it to SQL in our backend. Many user-facing features use it.\n\n - Specced, designed, and implemented a feature that allows users to complete signing offers entirely within Ashby. This project involved talking to customers to understand their requirements, deciding what technologies to use, building a prototype, and working with other team members to integrate the final implementation into additional features.\n\n\nWHAT WE’RE BUILDING\n\nAs engineers, we are used to tooling that makes us better at what we do. When we started Ashby, we saw the opposite with Talent Acquisition software. Recruiting teams were leveling up how they did their work, but instead of software meeting this new standard, it held them back.\n\nScheduling a final round is an excellent example. Recruiting teams wanted to schedule candidates faster, track interviewer preparation and quality, and do it with half the headcount. A recruiter needed to manually collect availability from the candidate, identify qualified interviewers, perform “Calendar Tetris” to find who is available to interview the candidate, schedule on the earliest date possible, and make any last-minute adjustments as availability changed. They must do this while considering the interview load on each individual and whether interviewers need to be trained and shadowing others. 🥵 TA software didn’t help.\n\nAs hiring managers, we know TA is a critical function, and as engineers, we know software can do better. So, we built and continue to build Ashby to give TA teams the highest standard of tooling. Software that’s intelligent and powerful. Software that provides insights into where they’re failing and automates or simplifies many of the tasks they’re underwater with. We want other functions and departments to be jealous of what TA teams can do with Ashby, and today they often are!\n\n\nWHY YOU SHOULD OR SHOULDN’T APPLY\n\nSoftware engineers come in many flavors, not all of which fit our model. Here are some things to help you decide if this fits you and what you’re looking for:\n\n - You’re not afraid to tackle any part of a technology stack. You do what’s necessary to successfully deliver a feature, whether writing frontend or choosing new infrastructure. We’ll provide a supportive environment to do it successfully (e.g., design system, SRE team).\n\n - You’ve tackled projects with a lot of product and technical ambiguity, and you thrive at the intersection of the two. We’re not building a simple CRUD app, and many of the challenges we tackle require you to use your knowledge of our customers to build powerful abstractions and flexibility in the system to solve a class of problems.\n\n - You know how to strike the right balance between speed and quality. Ashby wasn’t built quickly. We took four years to launch publicly because convincing customers to switch required a high-quality product. However, time isn’t infinite, especially for a startup, so we still move with urgency—we’ve built the equivalent of three or more VC-backed startups with a very small team.\n\n - You are ambitious and always looking to improve your skills. For most engineers, this role will give you more freedom and responsibilities than you’ve experienced in the past. To thrive (and level up), you’ll need to be open to feedback (and we give lots of it).\n\n - You’re an excellent collaborator and communicator. Ownership and freedom don’t mean you work in a vacuum. You’ll need to vet your decisions with the appropriate stakeholders, keep them up to date when necessary, and work with other engineers to get your projects across the finish line. Clear and concise communication helps a lot here!\n\n - You seek to create leverage in your work. The nature of software is that you can often automate or abstract what would be tedious, time-consuming work. Your impatience usually leads to new abstractions, tools to allow Support to debug before Engineering, new lint rules to prevent common bugs, etc.\n\nPut another way, you shouldn’t apply if:\n\n - You need company-driven process and structure to get your projects across the finish line. Sprint planning and well-defined project management processes are things you need or look to others to lead. You’d rather focus on the technical details and challenges.\n\n - You only want to do exciting work. We’re building a team of kind, collaborative folks. Customer issues and investigations are distributed across the team, including our high-level ICs.\n\n - You can get lost in the details. Once you start implementation, it can be hard to take a step back and think about the project as a whole. You like everything to be planned upfront.\n\n - You haven’t led or taken ownership of projects before. You’re used to working with tech leads and taking on tasks distributed by them.\n\n - You want to mentor earlier-career engineers. We rely on engineers owning their projects, so we need engineers with that experience. This requires the team to be reasonably tenured. More than 90% of the team would be considered Senior or above in the industry today, so mentorship opportunities are very limited.\n\n - To you, a tech lead, staff, or principal engineer is someone who spends most of their time project managing or doing architecture reviews. Our most tenured engineers spend most of their time building, and we often trust them with our most challenging problems. While they lead product and technical areas and help other engineers plan their most challenging work, it’s not a requirement, nor do engineers need their sign-off.\n\n\nENGINEERING CULTURE\n\nOur engineering culture is motivated by Benji’s (my Co-founder and CEO) and my belief that a small, talented team, given the right environment, can build high-quality software fast (and work regular hours!). We do it through:\n\n - Minimal process with ownership over decisions normally made by product and design\n\n - Natural collaboration and deliberate communication\n\n - Investing in tools and abstractions that give us leverage\n\n - Putting effort into building a diverse team\n\n\nMINIMAL PROCESS & LOTS OF OWNERSHIP\n\nThe best engineers we’ve worked with delivered reliably magical outcomes. They took customer problems and relentlessly drove them to solutions that were not only successful but often brilliant and creative. While they did this with minimal oversight, stakeholders were never in the dark as to what was going on, and no setback was a surprise.\n\nTraditional product-development processes aren’t meant for the best engineers. Their purpose is to create consistent outcomes regardless of the engineer’s skill. But, consistency comes at the expense of an engineer’s time and freedom—both ingredients necessary to generate those magical outcomes. As a result, process stifles the best engineers and doesn’t give others the opportunity to practice the behaviors that made the best engineers the “best.”\n\nAt Ashby, we want to build an environment that encourages every engineer to be their best. So, at Ashby, every Engineer runs their project. Product Managers (and Designers) build strategy, do customer research, and hand off problem briefs to Engineers. Engineers take on the rest: they research the problem, write product specs, build wireframes, and implement their solution end-to-end. We rely on engineers, not process, to push information outward to the relevant folks (e.g., Product Managers) and pull folks in to help (e.g., Designers, Infra). It’s a new level of ownership for many engineers, but we’d rather an engineer fail a bit and coach up their skills than use process as a crutch. Not everyone succeeds in our culture, but those who do thrive.\n\n\nCOLLABORATION IS NATURAL & COMMUNICATION IS DELIBERATE\n\nOur engineering team consists of lifelong learners who are talented but also humble and kind (meet them here https://www.ashbyhq.com/team!). These attributes create an environment where collaboration happens naturally. We combine this with research, prototyping, and written proposals to see around corners and get feedback from the team across time zones. Focus time is something that we hold sacred, and, with thoughtful and deliberate communication, engineers are in <2h meetings per week (I wrote about it here https://www.ashbyhq.com/blog/company/thoughtful-communication).\n\nTo drive it home, here's a recent calendar of an engineer who has been with us for over 4 years:\n\n[https://app.ashbyhq.com/api/images/user-content/4ea5f68e-c33e-4ac9-831a-e732bee4a303/d4679311-9dba-4031-bf5e-19ce78597ab1/calendar.png]\n\nWe also meet in person at least twice a year, once as a department and once as a company. You also have a small budget to meet up with folks in your city/region.\n\n\nINCREASE LEVERAGE, NOT TEAM SIZE\n\nWe built Ashby with the quality, breadth, and depth that many customers would expect from much larger teams over larger time scales. We’ve done this through investment in:\n\n - Great developer tooling. Our CI/CD takes ~10m, and we deploy at least 15x a day. A debugger that works out of the box. Everyone on the team has contributed to our developer experience 💪🏾.\n\n - Building blocks to create powerful and customizable products fast. At the core of Ashby is a set of common components (analytics modeling and query language, policy engine, workflow engine, design system) that we constantly improve. Each improvement to a common component cascades throughout our app (short video below).\n\nHere’s an impromptu quote from Arjun in our company Slack of what it’s like to build a feature at Ashby:\n\n[https://app.ashbyhq.com/api/images/user-content/4ea5f68e-c33e-4ac9-831a-e732bee4a303/8d94727a-46d8-42a2-9627-ddcd7f822f95/arjun.png]\n\nAnd a demo of one of these building blocks:\n\n\nPUT EFFORT INTO DIVERSITY\n\nDiverse teams drive innovation and better outcomes. Having seen my mother and partner build their careers as minority women in non-diverse fields, I want to make sure Ashby creates opportunities for the next generation of engineers from underrepresented groups.\n\nToday, 21% of engineers at Ashby are from underrepresented groups. It’s not great, and we are taking conscious steps to improve, like sourcing diverse candidates, providing generous paid family leave, no leetcode interviews, and more.\n\n\nINTERVIEW PROCESS\n\nAt Ashby, our team and interview process want to help you show your best self. We’ll dive into past projects and simulate working together via pair programming, writing product and tech specs collaboratively, and talking through decisions. There are no leetcode or whiteboard exercises.\n\nOur interview process is three rounds:\n\n 1. Introduction call with Hiring Manager (15 to 30m, live)\n\n 2. A technical screen where we pair in our actual codebase (1h, live)\n\n 3. Three non-coding interviews that focus on product thinking, technical design, and infrastructure (3h 15m, live can be split across multiple days)\n\nDepending on our leadership team’s bandwidth, we may start with an additional 30m screen with a recruiter.\n\nYour hiring manager will be your main point of contact and prep you for interviews. Each round will have written guidance so you know what to expect (you’ll need minimal preparation). You’ll meet 4 to 6 people in engineering (with 5-15 minutes in each interview to ask them questions). If we don’t give an offer, we’ll provide feedback!\n\n\nYOUR FIRST THREE MONTHS AT ASHBY\n\nWe want an exceptional onboarding experience for every new hire. At Ashby, your dev environment is set up with a single script, you push your first product change on day one, and you spend the rest of your time shipping product changes that give you a tour of our codebase and best practices. The product changes increase in scope and ambiguity from simple copy changes to the delivery of a prominent, impactful feature. Your manager will do a 30, 60, and 90-day review to give feedback and calibrate on how we work together.\n\nIt’s a team effort to get you successfully onboarded; you’ll have a peer paired with you to answer questions, pair program, and check in often to see if you need help. The rest of the team will run training sessions on our culture, product, engineering process, and technical architecture.\n\n\nTECHNOLOGY STACK\n\nI’m sharing our tech stack with the caveat that we don’t require previous experience in it (but a love of typed languages is helpful 😀): TypeScript (frontend & backend), React, GraphQL API, Node.js, Postgres, Redis.\n\nWhen they joined Ashby, many of our engineers switched from other languages like Swift and Kotlin (Ben https://linkedin.com/in/benasher44/), platforms like iOS (Tom https://www.linkedin.com/in/tom-quist-0925a199/) and Windows (Sergey https://www.linkedin.com/in/sergeygalich/). We care more about fundamentals (e.g., debugging, abstractions) and how fast you learn. For folks on the team who switched, it's nice seeing changes hot reload versus waiting for XCode to compile 😅.\n\n\nBENEFITS\n\n - Competitive salary and equity.\n\n - 10-year exercise window for stock options. You shouldn’t feel pressure to purchase stock options if you leave Ashby —do it when you feel financially comfortable.\n\n - Unlimited PTO, and we will encourage you to take it.\n\n - A minimum of 12 weeks of fully paid parental leave, covered by Ashby. For folks outside the US, it may be longer to be in line with regional requirements.\n\n - Generous equipment, software, and office furniture budget. Get what you need to be happy and productive!\n\n - $100/month education budget with more expensive items (like conferences) covered with manager approval.\n\n - If you’re in the US, we offer top-tier health insurance for you and your dependents, with 100% of premiums covered by Ashby. In other countries, we provide high-quality supplemental health insurance for you and your dependents, also fully covered by us.\n\nAshby’s success hinges on hiring great people and creating an environment where we can be happy, feel challenged, and do our best work. We’re being deliberate about building that environment from the ground up. I hope that excites you enough to apply.\n\nAshby provides equal employment opportunities (EEO) to all employees and applicants for employment without regard to race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability, genetics, sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression. We are committed to a diverse and inclusive workforce and welcome people from all backgrounds, experiences, perspectives, and abilities.",

            "descriptionHtml": "<p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Hi 👋🏾 I’m <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/abhikpramanik\"><u>Abhik</u></a>, Ashby's Co-Founder and VP of Engineering. We’re looking for an ambitious full-stack engineer who is laser-focused on solving customer problems and making the right long-term investments to solve them not only today but in our future features and products.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">What Ashby gives you in return is the best of both early and growth-stage environments. The agency and no-nonsense of a seed startup: you write product specs, make product and design decisions, and build in an almost-no-meeting culture. While also the product-market fit and scale of a growth-stage startup: tens of thousands of daily users who depend on your software and eagerly await your next feature.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We have notable customers like Notion, Linear, Shopify, and Snowflake. Our growth and retention metrics are best-in-class among our peers: we have tens of millions in ARR, growing &gt;100% year over year, very low churn, and many years of runway. We’ll share more details once we meet.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You’ve probably seen this role posted before, and it’s because we’re always expanding the team (we’re on track to double this year). We’re bubbling with ideas on how to support Talent Acquisition through software, and we’ve started the journey of building products beyond Talent Acquisition. We read every application and aim to respond to yours within 3-4 days (often sooner).</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1>About the Role and How We Work</h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Our engineering culture strives to recreate the environments where we did our best work as ICs – where we had the ownership and agency to impact our users with creative and innovative software.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">I started my career building software for artists in the Visual Effects industry. It was a formative experience for me as a software engineer because success relied on my ability to be a product manager and designer. I talked to artists to understand their needs. I came up with ideas. I did industry research, designed interfaces, and prototyped ideas. I watched artists use what I built and decided what to tackle in the next iteration. No daily stand-ups, no t-shirt sizing, no planning meetings.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">I studied computer science to solve problems, not tickets, and this felt exactly like that. I not only felt creative and fulfilled but the agency and ownership we were given as engineers powered an incredible amount of innovation.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Innovation came differently (or not at all) at technology startups beyond the seed stage, often through an engineer’s force of will and ability to push back against culture (rather than any encouragement from it). Engineering was narrowed to implementation and delivery, partly due to the influence of other departments and partly due to the influx of \"Agile\" processes like sprint planning. In those companies, I felt like a JIRA jockey. </p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">At Ashby, we’re building an environment that is optimistic about what engineers can own and achieve. An environment that embraces innovative engineers, and, frankly, often stays out of their way. As a Product Engineer, you’ll take ownership over a large portion of one of our products and own projects end-to-end (wearing hats traditionally worn by product and design). You’ll research competitors, write product specs, make wireframes, and more. To ground it with examples, product engineers at Ashby have:</p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Designed and built automated interview scheduling. This feature automates scheduling by calculating possible times from a pool of interviewers and other constraints, and then presenting these times to the candidate for selection via our responsive web app. This solves the “Calendar Tetris” problem I talk about in \"What We're Building.\"</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Built a generalized declarative filter architecture that allows users to create complex filters for any record with a consistent UI and compile it to SQL in our backend. Many user-facing features use it.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Specced, designed, and implemented a feature that allows users to complete signing offers entirely within Ashby. This project involved talking to customers to understand their requirements, deciding what technologies to use, building a prototype, and working with other team members to integrate the final implementation into additional features.</p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1>What We’re Building</h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">As engineers, we are used to tooling that makes us <strong>better</strong> at what we do. When we started Ashby, we saw the opposite with Talent Acquisition software. Recruiting teams were leveling up how they did their work, but instead of software meeting this new standard, it held them back.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Scheduling a final round is an excellent example. Recruiting teams wanted to schedule candidates faster, track interviewer preparation and quality, and do it with half the headcount. A recruiter needed to manually collect availability from the candidate, identify qualified interviewers, perform “Calendar Tetris” to find who is available to interview the candidate, schedule on the earliest date possible, and make any last-minute adjustments as availability changed. They must do this while considering the interview load on each individual and whether interviewers need to be trained and shadowing others. 🥵 TA software didn’t help.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">As hiring managers, we know TA is a critical function, and as engineers, we know software can do better. So, we built and continue to build Ashby to give TA teams the <em>highest</em> standard of tooling. Software that’s intelligent and powerful. Software that provides insights into where they’re failing and automates or simplifies many of the tasks they’re underwater with. We want other functions and departments to be jealous of what TA teams can do with Ashby, and today they often are!</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1>Why You Should or Shouldn’t Apply</h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Software engineers come in many flavors, not all of which fit our model. Here are some things  to help you decide if this fits you and what you’re looking for:</p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You’re not afraid to tackle any part of a technology stack.</em> You do what’s necessary to successfully deliver a feature, whether writing frontend or choosing new infrastructure. We’ll provide a supportive environment to do it successfully (e.g., design system, SRE team).</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You’ve tackled projects with a lot of product and technical ambiguity, and you thrive at the intersection of the two. </em>We’re not building a simple CRUD app, and many of the challenges we tackle require you to use your knowledge of our customers to build powerful abstractions and flexibility in the system to solve a class of problems.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You know how to strike the right balance between speed and quality. </em>Ashby wasn’t built quickly. We took four years to launch publicly because convincing customers to switch required a high-quality product. However, time isn’t infinite, especially for a startup, so we still move with urgency—we’ve built the equivalent of three or more VC-backed startups with a very small team.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You are ambitious and always looking to improve your skills. </em>For most engineers, this role will give you more freedom and responsibilities than you’ve experienced in the past. To thrive (and level up), you’ll need to be open to feedback (and we give lots of it).</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You’re an excellent collaborator and communicator. </em>Ownership and freedom don’t mean you work in a vacuum. You’ll need to vet your decisions with the appropriate stakeholders, keep them up to date when necessary, and work with other engineers to get your projects across the finish line. Clear and concise communication helps a lot here!</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You seek to create leverage in your work. </em>The nature of software is that you can often automate or abstract what would be tedious, time-consuming work. Your impatience usually leads to new abstractions, tools to allow Support to debug before Engineering, new lint rules to prevent common bugs, etc. </p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><strong>Put another way, you shouldn’t apply if:</strong></p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You need company-driven process and structure to get your projects across the finish line. </em>Sprint planning and well-defined project management processes are things you need or look to others to lead. You’d rather focus on the technical details and challenges.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You only want to do exciting work. </em>We’re building a team of kind, collaborative folks. Customer issues and investigations are distributed across the team, including our high-level ICs.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You can get lost in the details.</em> Once you start implementation, it can be hard to take a step back and think about the project as a whole. You like everything to be planned upfront.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You haven’t led or taken ownership of projects before.</em> You’re used to working with tech leads and taking on tasks distributed by them.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You want to mentor earlier-career engineers.</em> We rely on engineers owning their projects, so we need engineers with that experience. This requires the team to be reasonably tenured. More than 90% of the team would be considered Senior or above in the industry today, so mentorship opportunities are very limited.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>To you, a tech lead, staff, or principal engineer is someone who spends most of their time project managing or doing architecture reviews. </em>Our most tenured engineers spend most of their time building, and we often trust them with our most challenging problems. While they lead product and technical areas and help other engineers plan their most challenging work, it’s not a requirement, nor do engineers need their sign-off.</p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1>Engineering Culture</h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Our engineering culture is motivated by Benji’s (my Co-founder and CEO) and my belief that a small, talented team, given the right environment, can build high-quality software fast (and work regular hours!). We do it through:</p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Minimal process with ownership over decisions normally made by product and design</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Natural collaboration and deliberate communication</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Investing in tools and abstractions that give us leverage</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Putting effort into building a diverse team</p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h2><strong>Minimal Process &amp; Lots of Ownership</strong></h2><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">The best engineers we’ve worked with delivered reliably magical outcomes. They took customer problems and relentlessly drove them to solutions that were not only successful but often brilliant and creative. While they did this with minimal oversight, stakeholders were never in the dark as to what was going on, and no setback was a surprise.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Traditional product-development processes aren’t meant for the best engineers. Their purpose is to create consistent outcomes regardless of the engineer’s skill. But, consistency comes at the expense of an engineer’s time and freedom—both ingredients necessary to generate those magical outcomes. As a result, process stifles the best engineers and doesn’t give others the opportunity to practice the behaviors that made the best engineers the “best.”</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">At Ashby, we want to build an environment that encourages every engineer to be their best. So, at Ashby, every Engineer runs their project. Product Managers (and Designers) build strategy, do customer research, and hand off problem briefs to Engineers. Engineers take on the rest: they research the problem, write product specs, build wireframes, and implement their solution end-to-end. We rely on engineers, not process, to push information outward to the relevant folks (e.g., Product Managers) and pull folks in to help (e.g., Designers, Infra). It’s a new level of ownership for many engineers, but we’d rather an engineer fail a bit and coach up their skills than use process as a crutch. Not everyone succeeds in our culture, but those who do <em>thrive</em>.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h2><strong>Collaboration is Natural &amp; Communication is Deliberate</strong></h2><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Our engineering team consists of lifelong learners who are talented but also humble and kind (meet them <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://www.ashbyhq.com/team\"><u>here</u></a>!). These attributes create an environment where collaboration happens naturally. We combine this with research, prototyping, and written proposals to see around corners and get feedback from the team across time zones. Focus time is something that we hold sacred, and, with thoughtful and deliberate communication, engineers are in &lt;2h meetings per week (I wrote about it <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://www.ashbyhq.com/blog/company/thoughtful-communication\"><u>here</u></a>).</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">To drive it home, here's a recent calendar of an engineer who has been with us for over 4 years:</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><div style=\"text-align:left\"><img style=\"max-width:100%\" src=\"https://app.ashbyhq.com/api/images/user-content/4ea5f68e-c33e-4ac9-831a-e732bee4a303/d4679311-9dba-4031-bf5e-19ce78597ab1/calendar.png\" /></div><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We also meet in person at least twice a year, once as a department and once as a company. You also have a small budget to meet up with folks in your city/region.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h2><strong>Increase Leverage, not Team Size</strong></h2><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We built Ashby with the quality, breadth, and depth that many customers would expect from much larger teams over larger time scales. We’ve done this through investment in:</p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><strong>Great developer tooling.</strong> Our CI/CD takes ~10m, and we deploy at least 15x a day. A debugger that works out of the box. Everyone on the team has contributed to our developer experience 💪🏾.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><strong>Building blocks to create powerful and customizable products fast.</strong> At the core of Ashby is a set of common components (analytics modeling and query language, policy engine, workflow engine, design system) that we constantly improve. Each improvement to a common component cascades throughout our app (short video below).</p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Here’s an impromptu quote from Arjun in our company Slack of what it’s like to build a feature at Ashby:</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><div style=\"text-align:left\"><img style=\"max-width:100%\" src=\"https://app.ashbyhq.com/api/images/user-content/4ea5f68e-c33e-4ac9-831a-e732bee4a303/8d94727a-46d8-42a2-9627-ddcd7f822f95/arjun.png\" /></div><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">And a demo of one of these building blocks:</p><div><div style=\"left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:62.5%\"><iframe src=\"https://embedded-media.ashbyhq.com/embed/4ea5f68e-c33e-4ac9-831a-e732bee4a303/9a5f032d-c731-411e-98cf-261517156f01\" style=\"top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0\" allowfullscreen scrolling=\"no\" allow=\"encrypted-media *; picture-in-picture *;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-presentation\"></iframe></div></div><h2><strong>Put Effort into Diversity</strong></h2><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Diverse teams drive innovation and better outcomes. Having seen my mother and partner build their careers as minority women in non-diverse fields, I want to make sure Ashby creates opportunities for the next generation of engineers from underrepresented groups.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Today, 21% of engineers at Ashby are from underrepresented groups. It’s not great, and we are taking conscious steps to improve, like sourcing diverse candidates, providing generous paid family leave, no leetcode interviews, and more.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1><strong>Interview Process</strong></h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">At Ashby, our team and interview process want to help you show your best self. We’ll dive into past projects and simulate working together via pair programming, writing product and tech specs collaboratively, and talking through decisions. There are no leetcode or whiteboard exercises.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Our interview process is three rounds:</p><ol style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Introduction call with Hiring Manager (15 to 30m, live)</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">A technical screen where we pair in our actual codebase (1h, live)</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Three non-coding interviews that focus on product thinking, technical design, and infrastructure (3h 15m, live can be split across multiple days)</p></li></ol><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Depending on our leadership team’s bandwidth, we may start with an <em>additional</em> 30m screen with a recruiter.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Your hiring manager will be your main point of contact and prep you for interviews. Each round will have written guidance so you know what to expect (you’ll need minimal preparation). You’ll meet 4 to 6 people in engineering (with 5-15 minutes in each interview to ask them questions). If we don’t give an offer, we’ll provide feedback!</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1><strong>Your First Three Months at Ashby</strong></h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We want an exceptional onboarding experience for every new hire. At Ashby, your dev environment is set up with a single script, you push your first product change on day one, and you spend the rest of your time shipping product changes that give you a tour of our codebase and best practices. The product changes increase in scope and ambiguity from simple copy changes to the delivery of a prominent, impactful feature. Your manager will do a 30, 60, and 90-day review to give feedback and calibrate on how we work together.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">It’s a team effort to get you successfully onboarded; you’ll have a peer paired with you to answer questions, pair program, and check in often to see if you need help. The rest of the team will run training sessions on our culture, product, engineering process, and technical architecture.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1><strong>Technology Stack</strong></h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">I’m sharing our tech stack with the caveat that we don’t require previous experience in it (but a love of typed languages is helpful 😀): TypeScript (frontend &amp; backend), React, GraphQL API, Node.js, Postgres, Redis.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">When they joined Ashby, many of our engineers switched from other languages like Swift and Kotlin (<a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://linkedin.com/in/benasher44/\"><u>Ben</u></a>), platforms like iOS (<a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/tom-quist-0925a199/\"><u>Tom</u></a>) and Windows (<a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/sergeygalich/\"><u>Sergey</u></a>).

            "descriptionPlain": "Hi 👋🏾 I’m Abhik https://www.linkedin.com/in/abhikpramanik, Ashby's Co-Founder and VP of Engineering. We’re looking for an ambitious full-stack engineer who is laser-focused on solving customer problems and making the right long-term investments to solve them not only today but in our future features and products.\n\nWhat Ashby gives you in return is the best of both early and growth-stage environments. The agency and no-nonsense of a seed startup: you write product specs, make product and design decisions, and build in an almost-no-meeting culture. While also the product-market fit and scale of a growth-stage startup: tens of thousands of daily users who depend on your software and eagerly await your next feature.\n\nWe have notable customers like Notion, Linear, Shopify, and Snowflake. Our growth and retention metrics are best-in-class among our peers: we have tens of millions in ARR, growing >100% year over year, very low churn, and many years of runway. We’ll share more details once we meet.\n\nYou’ve probably seen this role posted before, and it’s because we’re always expanding the team (we’re on track to double this year). We’re bubbling with ideas on how to support Talent Acquisition through software, and we’ve started the journey of building products beyond Talent Acquisition. We read every application and aim to respond to yours within 3-4 days (often sooner).\n\n\nABOUT THE ROLE AND HOW WE WORK\n\nOur engineering culture strives to recreate the environments where we did our best work as ICs – where we had the ownership and agency to impact our users with creative and innovative software.\n\nI started my career building software for artists in the Visual Effects industry. It was a formative experience for me as a software engineer because success relied on my ability to be a product manager and designer. I talked to artists to understand their needs. I came up with ideas. I did industry research, designed interfaces, and prototyped ideas. I watched artists use what I built and decided what to tackle in the next iteration. No daily stand-ups, no t-shirt sizing, no planning meetings.\n\nI studied computer science to solve problems, not tickets, and this felt exactly like that. I not only felt creative and fulfilled but the agency and ownership we were given as engineers powered an incredible amount of innovation.\n\nInnovation came differently (or not at all) at technology startups beyond the seed stage, often through an engineer’s force of will and ability to push back against culture (rather than any encouragement from it). Engineering was narrowed to implementation and delivery, partly due to the influence of other departments and partly due to the influx of \"Agile\" processes like sprint planning. In those companies, I felt like a JIRA jockey.\n\nAt Ashby, we’re building an environment that is optimistic about what engineers can own and achieve. An environment that embraces innovative engineers, and, frankly, often stays out of their way. As a Product Engineer, you’ll take ownership over a large portion of one of our products and own projects end-to-end (wearing hats traditionally worn by product and design). You’ll research competitors, write product specs, make wireframes, and more. To ground it with examples, product engineers at Ashby have:\n\n - Designed and built automated interview scheduling. This feature automates scheduling by calculating possible times from a pool of interviewers and other constraints, and then presenting these times to the candidate for selection via our responsive web app. This solves the “Calendar Tetris” problem I talk about in \"What We're Building.\"\n\n - Built a generalized declarative filter architecture that allows users to create complex filters for any record with a consistent UI and compile it to SQL in our backend. Many user-facing features use it.\n\n - Specced, designed, and implemented a feature that allows users to complete signing offers entirely within Ashby. This project involved talking to customers to understand their requirements, deciding what technologies to use, building a prototype, and working with other team members to integrate the final implementation into additional features.\n\n\nWHAT WE’RE BUILDING\n\nAs engineers, we are used to tooling that makes us better at what we do. When we started Ashby, we saw the opposite with Talent Acquisition software. Recruiting teams were leveling up how they did their work, but instead of software meeting this new standard, it held them back.\n\nScheduling a final round is an excellent example. Recruiting teams wanted to schedule candidates faster, track interviewer preparation and quality, and do it with half the headcount. A recruiter needed to manually collect availability from the candidate, identify qualified interviewers, perform “Calendar Tetris” to find who is available to interview the candidate, schedule on the earliest date possible, and make any last-minute adjustments as availability changed. They must do this while considering the interview load on each individual and whether interviewers need to be trained and shadowing others. 🥵 TA software didn’t help.\n\nAs hiring managers, we know TA is a critical function, and as engineers, we know software can do better. So, we built and continue to build Ashby to give TA teams the highest standard of tooling. Software that’s intelligent and powerful. Software that provides insights into where they’re failing and automates or simplifies many of the tasks they’re underwater with. We want other functions and departments to be jealous of what TA teams can do with Ashby, and today they often are!\n\n\nWHY YOU SHOULD OR SHOULDN’T APPLY\n\nSoftware engineers come in many flavors, not all of which fit our model. Here are some things to help you decide if this fits you and what you’re looking for:\n\n - You’re not afraid to tackle any part of a technology stack. You do what’s necessary to successfully deliver a feature, whether writing frontend or choosing new infrastructure. We’ll provide a supportive environment to do it successfully (e.g., design system, SRE team).\n\n - You’ve tackled projects with a lot of product and technical ambiguity, and you thrive at the intersection of the two. We’re not building a simple CRUD app, and many of the challenges we tackle require you to use your knowledge of our customers to build powerful abstractions and flexibility in the system to solve a class of problems.\n\n - You know how to strike the right balance between speed and quality. Ashby wasn’t built quickly. We took four years to launch publicly because convincing customers to switch required a high-quality product. However, time isn’t infinite, especially for a startup, so we still move with urgency—we’ve built the equivalent of three or more VC-backed startups with a very small team.\n\n - You are ambitious and always looking to improve your skills. For most engineers, this role will give you more freedom and responsibilities than you’ve experienced in the past. To thrive (and level up), you’ll need to be open to feedback (and we give lots of it).\n\n - You’re an excellent collaborator and communicator. Ownership and freedom don’t mean you work in a vacuum. You’ll need to vet your decisions with the appropriate stakeholders, keep them up to date when necessary, and work with other engineers to get your projects across the finish line. Clear and concise communication helps a lot here!\n\n - You seek to create leverage in your work. The nature of software is that you can often automate or abstract what would be tedious, time-consuming work. Your impatience usually leads to new abstractions, tools to allow Support to debug before Engineering, new lint rules to prevent common bugs, etc.\n\nPut another way, you shouldn’t apply if:\n\n - You need company-driven process and structure to get your projects across the finish line. Sprint planning and well-defined project management processes are things you need or look to others to lead. You’d rather focus on the technical details and challenges.\n\n - You only want to do exciting work. We’re building a team of kind, collaborative folks. Customer issues and investigations are distributed across the team, including our high-level ICs.\n\n - You can get lost in the details. Once you start implementation, it can be hard to take a step back and think about the project as a whole. You like everything to be planned upfront.\n\n - You haven’t led or taken ownership of projects before. You’re used to working with tech leads and taking on tasks distributed by them.\n\n - You want to mentor earlier-career engineers. We rely on engineers owning their projects, so we need engineers with that experience. This requires the team to be reasonably tenured. More than 90% of the team would be considered Senior or above in the industry today, so mentorship opportunities are very limited.\n\n - To you, a tech lead, staff, or principal engineer is someone who spends most of their time project managing or doing architecture reviews. Our most tenured engineers spend most of their time building, and we often trust them with our most challenging problems. While they lead product and technical areas and help other engineers plan their most challenging work, it’s not a requirement, nor do engineers need their sign-off.\n\n\nENGINEERING CULTURE\n\nOur engineering culture is motivated by Benji’s (my Co-founder and CEO) and my belief that a small, talented team, given the right environment, can build high-quality software fast (and work regular hours!). We do it through:\n\n - Minimal process with ownership over decisions normally made by product and design\n\n - Natural collaboration and deliberate communication\n\n - Investing in tools and abstractions that give us leverage\n\n - Putting effort into building a diverse team\n\n\nMINIMAL PROCESS & LOTS OF OWNERSHIP\n\nThe best engineers we’ve worked with delivered reliably magical outcomes. They took customer problems and relentlessly drove them to solutions that were not only successful but often brilliant and creative. While they did this with minimal oversight, stakeholders were never in the dark as to what was going on, and no setback was a surprise.\n\nTraditional product-development processes aren’t meant for the best engineers. Their purpose is to create consistent outcomes regardless of the engineer’s skill. But, consistency comes at the expense of an engineer’s time and freedom—both ingredients necessary to generate those magical outcomes. As a result, process stifles the best engineers and doesn’t give others the opportunity to practice the behaviors that made the best engineers the “best.”\n\nAt Ashby, we want to build an environment that encourages every engineer to be their best. So, at Ashby, every Engineer runs their project. Product Managers (and Designers) build strategy, do customer research, and hand off problem briefs to Engineers. Engineers take on the rest: they research the problem, write product specs, build wireframes, and implement their solution end-to-end. We rely on engineers, not process, to push information outward to the relevant folks (e.g., Product Managers) and pull folks in to help (e.g., Designers, Infra). It’s a new level of ownership for many engineers, but we’d rather an engineer fail a bit and coach up their skills than use process as a crutch. Not everyone succeeds in our culture, but those who do thrive.\n\n\nCOLLABORATION IS NATURAL & COMMUNICATION IS DELIBERATE\n\nOur engineering team consists of lifelong learners who are talented but also humble and kind (meet them here https://www.ashbyhq.com/team!). These attributes create an environment where collaboration happens naturally. We combine this with research, prototyping, and written proposals to see around corners and get feedback from the team across time zones. Focus time is something that we hold sacred, and, with thoughtful and deliberate communication, engineers are in <2h meetings per week (I wrote about it here https://www.ashbyhq.com/blog/company/thoughtful-communication).\n\nTo drive it home, here's a recent calendar of an engineer who has been with us for over 4 years:\n\n[https://app.ashbyhq.com/api/images/user-content/4ea5f68e-c33e-4ac9-831a-e732bee4a303/d4679311-9dba-4031-bf5e-19ce78597ab1/calendar.png]\n\nWe also meet in person at least twice a year, once as a department and once as a company. You also have a small budget to meet up with folks in your city/region.\n\n\nINCREASE LEVERAGE, NOT TEAM SIZE\n\nWe built Ashby with the quality, breadth, and depth that many customers would expect from much larger teams over larger time scales. We’ve done this through investment in:\n\n - Great developer tooling. Our CI/CD takes ~10m, and we deploy at least 15x a day. A debugger that works out of the box. Everyone on the team has contributed to our developer experience 💪🏾.\n\n - Building blocks to create powerful and customizable products fast. At the core of Ashby is a set of common components (analytics modeling and query language, policy engine, workflow engine, design system) that we constantly improve. Each improvement to a common component cascades throughout our app (short video below).\n\nHere’s an impromptu quote from Arjun in our company Slack of what it’s like to build a feature at Ashby:\n\n[https://app.ashbyhq.com/api/images/user-content/4ea5f68e-c33e-4ac9-831a-e732bee4a303/8d94727a-46d8-42a2-9627-ddcd7f822f95/arjun.png]\n\nAnd a demo of one of these building blocks:\n\n\nPUT EFFORT INTO DIVERSITY\n\nDiverse teams drive innovation and better outcomes. Having seen my mother and partner build their careers as minority women in non-diverse fields, I want to make sure Ashby creates opportunities for the next generation of engineers from underrepresented groups.\n\nToday, 21% of engineers at Ashby are from underrepresented groups. It’s not great, and we are taking conscious steps to improve, like sourcing diverse candidates, providing generous paid family leave, no leetcode interviews, and more.\n\n\nINTERVIEW PROCESS\n\nAt Ashby, our team and interview process want to help you show your best self.

There are no leetcode or whiteboard exercises.\n\nOur interview process is three rounds:\n\n 1. Introduction call with Hiring Manager (15 to 30m, live)\n\n 2. A technical screen where we pair in our actual codebase (1h, live)\n\n 3. Three non-coding interviews that focus on product thinking, technical design, and infrastructure (3h 15m, live can be split across multiple days)\n\nDepending on our leadership team’s bandwidth, we may start with an additional 30m screen with a recruiter.\n\nYour hiring manager will be your main point of contact and prep you for interviews.

            "descriptionHtml": "<p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We’re looking for a curious, rigorous, problem-hungry platform engineer (who codes!) to carry the ball as we bring Ashby to the big leagues. Ashby builds software that lets talent teams build an efficient, delightful, respectful hiring process. Similarly, you’re an engineer who wants to build a “paved road” that excellent engineering teams can safely take to the moon and back.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We have notable customers like Notion, Linear, Shopify, and Snowflake. Our growth and retention metrics are best-in-class among our peers: we have tens of millions in ARR, growing &gt;100% year over year, over 2500 customers, very low churn, and many years of runway. We’ll share more details once we meet, but you now probably have a good idea as to why we're hiring for this role 😅.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We’ve listed this role twice: as a Platform Engineer and Site Reliability Engineer – our team does both, and we are open to candidates who lean towards one or the other. </p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1>About the role and how we work</h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Hi 👋 I’m<a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://uk.linkedin.com/in/colinhoweuk\"> <u>Colin</u></a>, Head of EMEA Engineering. I’ve spent a number of years leading engineering teams in startups, and that has always included being close to infrastructure teams - no matter what name they’ve worn (SRE, infrastructure, platform, etc). I’ve got my hands dirty building the initial infrastructure for startups and know the value a talented infrastructure engineer brings. The rigour, the discipline, the peace and quiet when everything just <em>hums along</em>.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Our infrastructure is in a good place <em>for now</em>. Nothing is static. Ashby continues to grow rapidly, putting strain on our existing infrastructure. We’re always looking to give our customers more powerful hiring software, and building new product features often requires new pieces of infrastructure.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Having herded plenty of <em>snowflakeservers</em> in the past, I’ve learned there’s a better way. I (and Ashby) place a lot of value on code-as-infrastructure. As a Platform Engineer at Ashby, you’ll get to dive into scaling problems, add new capabilities to our platform, and think about how our entire team interacts with infrastructure. All our own engineers own their projects end-to-end and ship with minimal oversight. We don’t put roadblocks to ensure security when common sense will do and we don’t build processes like change management boards around the lowest common denominator. But with great power comes great responsibility: we handle personal and confidential data about some of the biggest decisions we ever make at work. As we grow, more and bigger customers rely on us to be reliable and secure and how we operate internally will need to evolve.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We’re at an inflection point where our ability to scale and deliver a seamless experience has a make-or-break impact – we have some of the fastest growing companies using our platform every day to hire hundreds of people per month. We need someone like you to make good decisions, debug thorny issues, and build us a future-proof platform that can withstand this scale. Our small but mighty infrastructure team has set up a secure and simple environment (we don’t believe in spinning up a new service unless necessary!) for our growing product team to build in. That’s where you come in: you, too, will own projects end-to-end and have an impact on core parts of the Ashby developer and user experience. For instance, you could work on:</p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Optimize <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://www.loom.com/share/32c0cc3eedf2450fb66a901b76186ce4\"><u>our homegrown ultra-dynamic recruiting DSL-to-SQL compiler</u></a>, and create tools to help developers do so</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Create automated guardrails for the security and privacy of our customer data</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Help our developers ship features fast through canary deploys, gradual rollouts and feature flags, while keeping complexity manageable and reducing downtime</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Work with the business and the engineering team to define SLOs and implement the corresponding SLIs.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Ensure all communication with external services supports retries and circuit-breakers.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Implement the infrastructure to support an event-driven architecture and data warehouse.</p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We’re looking for someone who can build systems that an engineer would like to work with: mature and boring but open-minded and approachable. We have to balance reliability with flexibility. Software and its availability are now mission critical to almost every working professional. To be in an SRE in today’s world, you have to be extremely comfortable evaluating risk, those you take and those others take.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1>Why you should or shouldn’t apply</h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You should apply if:</p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You never stop. You get weirdly obsessed about a problem that doesn’t yet make sense, turn it every which way in your head until the explanation dawns. You’ll search every rock, inventory every clue, hunt every mismatch. We do that, too - together we’ll be armed with state-of-the-art monitoring tools and an impressive amount of data, and join you in the adventure.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You don’t take shortcuts. You’re speaking up for the future user, the edge case, the doomsday design. You know product engineers want to build it with you, and see them as allies, where you give them the power and knowledge to access greater things.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You’re someone who cares about what you do and the team you do it with, and want to work with others who do as well. You’ll be on interview panels choosing your next colleagues, and you’ll take that seriously. You only want to work with people who make you better, and want to make you better.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You’ve built infrastructure at a slightly later stage than Ashby is at - you know how to deal with millions of data points, have seen great (or not great) infrastructure make or break customer experience, and have automated everything from provisioning to monitoring and release process.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You’re a Swiss army knife (all nationalities welcome ;) ). You’ll get every hard problem the company faces. You’ll get to do infrastructure updates, security enforcements, database optimization, Kubernetes debugging, and digging through Typescript traces figuring out what doesn’t work. You probably don’t feel like an expert at at least some of that... and that appeals to you.</p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">All that makes for a pretty specific kind of role, and the job isn’t to everyone’s tastes! You should not apply if:</p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You don’t want to make your own decisions on what is the best paved road to build for Ashby, and expect a lead or manager to make the final call on what that is. Our leads (and managers) give ample commentary and feedback on technical decisions and how they’re made, but you ship what you want to build and are accountable for it.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You hate SQL. We have a lot of features built around making the best out of data, and our platform engineers also sometimes dive into a gnarly report or advise engineers on a more performant data model to use.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You don’t want to code. Our SREs are some of our best software engineers and they are just as responsible for the application as the other engineering teams - albeit at a platform level. Reviewing code and submitting code changes will be part of your day to day.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Your primary mode of communicating best practices to engineers is live meetings. We’re a very async culture and written communication (and code) is how changes get made. As an Ashby SRE, you will need to share new tooling and best practices with engineers faster than your next meeting opportunity will take you.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You’ve never delivered a project, on your own, without someone prodding you for updates. We have no project or delivery managers to fill your calendar with busy work, but the flip side is you have to do your project management, seek the help you need to get unstuck and cut scope when it’s worthwhile.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p></li></ul><h1>Technology Stack</h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">I’m sharing our tech stack with the caveat that we don’t require previous experience in it: TypeScript (frontend &amp; backend), Node.js, React, Apollo GraphQL, Postgres, Redis.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We use Datadog and Sentry on 100% cloud-based (AWS) infra. We take developer experience and reliability seriously: all engineers are on call in a follow-the-sun model, and everyone contributes to developer tooling.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1>What We’re Building</h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">As engineers, we are used to tooling that makes us <strong>better</strong> at what we do. When we started Ashby, we saw the opposite with Talent Acquisition software. Recruiting teams were leveling up how they did their work, but instead of software meeting this new standard, it held them back.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Scheduling a final round is an excellent example. Recruiting teams wanted to schedule candidates faster, track interviewer preparation and quality, and do it with half the headcount. A recruiter needed to manually collect availability from the candidate, identify qualified interviewers, perform “Calendar Tetris” to find who is available to interview the candidate, schedule on the earliest date possible, and make any last-minute adjustments as availability changed. They must do this while considering the interview load on each individual and whether interviewers need to be trained and shadowing others. 🥵 TA software didn’t help.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">As hiring managers, we know TA is a critical function, and as engineers, we know software can do better. So, we built and continue to build Ashby to give TA teams the <em>highest</em> standard of tooling. Software that’s intelligent and powerful. Software that provides insights into where they’re failing and automates or simplifies many of the tasks they’re underwater with. We want other functions and departments to be jealous of what TA teams can do with Ashby, and today they often are!</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1>Engineering Culture</h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Our engineering culture is motivated by <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/abhikpramanik/\"><u>Abhik</u></a> and <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/benjaminencz/\"><u>Benji</u></a>’s (our co-founders) belief that a small talented team, given the right environment, can build high-quality software fast (and work regular hours!). We do it through:</p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Minimal process with ownership over decisions normally made by product and design</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Natural collaboration and deliberate communication</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Investing in tools and abstractions that give us leverage</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Putting effort into building a diverse team</p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h2><strong>Minimal Process &amp; Lots of Ownership</strong></h2><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">The best engineers we’ve worked with delivered reliably magical outcomes. They took customer problems and relentlessly drove them to solutions that were not only successful but often brilliant and creative. While they did this with minimal oversight, stakeholders were never in the dark as to what was going on, and no setback was a surprise.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Traditional product-development processes aren’t meant for the best engineers. Their purpose is to create consistent outcomes regardless of the engineer’s skill. But, consistency comes at the expense of an engineer’s time and freedom—both ingredients necessary to generate those magical outcomes. As a result, process stifles the best engineers and doesn’t give others the opportunity to practice the behaviors that made the best engineers the “best.”</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">At Ashby, we want to build an environment that encourages every engineer to be their best. So, at Ashby, every Engineer runs their project. Product Managers (and Designers) build strategy, do customer research, and hand off problem briefs to Engineers. Engineers take on the rest: they research the problem, write product specs, build wireframes, and implement their solution end-to-end. We rely on engineers, not process, to push information outward to the relevant folks (e.g., Product Managers) and pull folks in to help (e.g., Designers, Infra). It’s a new level of ownership for many engineers, but we’d rather an engineer fail a bit and coach up their skills than use process as a crutch. Not everyone succeeds in our culture, but those who do <em>thrive</em>.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h2><strong>Collaboration is Natural &amp; Communication is Deliberate</strong></h2><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Our engineering team consists of lifelong learners who are talented but also humble and kind (meet them <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://www.ashbyhq.com/team\"><u>here</u></a>!). These attributes create an environment where collaboration happens naturally. We combine this with research, prototyping, and written proposals to see around corners and get feedback from the team across time zones. Focus time is something that we hold sacred, and, with thoughtful and deliberate communication, engineers are in &lt;2h meetings per week (Abhik wrote about it <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://www.ashbyhq.com/blog/company/thoughtful-communication\"><u>here</u></a>).</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">To drive it home, here's a recent calendar of an engineer who has been with us for over 4 years:</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><div style=\"text-align:left\"><img style=\"max-width:100%\" src=\"https://app.ashbyhq.com/api/images/user-content/4ea5f68e-c33e-4ac9-831a-e732bee4a303/d4679311-9dba-4031-bf5e-19ce78597ab1/calendar.png\" /></div><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We also meet in person at least twice a year, once as a department and once as a company. You also have a small budget to meet up with folks in your city/region.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h2><strong>Increase Leverage, not Team Size</strong></h2><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We built Ashby with the quality, breadth, and depth that many customers would expect from much larger teams over larger time scales. We’ve done this through investment in:</p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><strong>Great developer tooling.</strong> Our CI/CD takes ~10m, and we deploy at least 15x a day. A debugger that works out of the box. Everyone on the team has contributed to our developer experience 💪🏾.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><strong>Building blocks to create powerful and customizable products fast.</strong> At the core of Ashby is a set of common components (analytics modeling and query language, policy engine, workflow engine, design system) that we constantly improve. Each improvement to a common component cascades throughout our app (short video below).</p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Here’s an impromptu quote from Arjun in our company Slack of what it’s like to build a feature at Ashby:</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><div style=\"text-align:left\"><img style=\"max-width:100%\" src=\"https://app.ashbyhq.com/api/images/user-content/4ea5f68e-c33e-4ac9-831a-e732bee4a303/8d94727a-46d8-42a2-9627-ddcd7f822f95/arjun.png\" /></div><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">And a demo of one of these building blocks:</p><div><div style=\"left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:62.5%\"><iframe src=\"https://embedded-media.ashbyhq.com/embed/4ea5f68e-c33e-4ac9-831a-e732bee4a303/9a5f032d-c731-411e-98cf-261517156f01\" style=\"top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0\" allowfullscreen scrolling=\"no\" allow=\"encrypted-media *; picture-in-picture *;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-presentation\"></iframe></div></div><h2><strong>Put Effort into Diversity</strong></h2><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Diverse teams drive innovation and better outcomes. Having seen my mother and partner build their careers as minority women in non-diverse fields, I want to make sure Ashby creates opportunities for the next generation of engineers from underrepresented groups.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Today, 21% of engineers at Ashby are from underrepresented groups. It’s not great, and we are taking conscious steps to improve, like sourcing diverse candidates, providing generous paid family leave, no leetcode interviews, and more.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1>Interview Process</h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">At Ashby, our team and interview process want to help you show your best self. We’ll dive into past projects and simulate working together via pair programming, writing product and tech specs collaboratively, and talking through decisions. There are no leetcode or whiteboard exercises.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Our interview process is three rounds:</p><ol style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Introduction call with Hiring Manager (15 to 30m, live)</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">A technical screen where we pair in our actual codebase (1h, live)</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Three non-coding interviews that focus on technical design, debugging incidents, and infrastructure (3h 15m, live can be split across multiple days)</p></li></ol><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Depending on our leadership team’s bandwidth, we may start with an <em>additional</em> 30m screen with a recruiter.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Your hiring manager will be your main point of contact and prep you for interviews. Each round will have written guidance so you know what to expect (you’ll need minimal preparation). You’ll meet 4 to 6 people in engineering (with 5-15 minutes in each interview to ask them questions). If we don’t give an offer, we’ll provide feedback!</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1><strong>Your First Three Months at Ashby</strong></h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We want an exceptional onboarding experience for every new hire. At Ashby, your dev environment is set up with a single script, you push your first product change on day one, and you spend the rest of your time shipping product changes that give you a tour of our codebase and best practices. The product changes increase in scope and ambiguity from simple copy changes to the delivery of a prominent, impactful feature. Your manager will do a 30, 60, and 90-day review to give feedback and calibrate on how we work together.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">It’s a team effort to get you successfully onboarded; you’ll have a peer paired with you to answer questions, pair program, and check in often to see if you need help.

            "descriptionPlain": "We’re looking for a curious, rigorous, problem-hungry platform engineer (who codes!) to carry the ball as we bring Ashby to the big leagues. Ashby builds software that lets talent teams build an efficient, delightful, respectful hiring process. Similarly, you’re an engineer who wants to build a “paved road” that excellent engineering teams can safely take to the moon and back.\n\nWe have notable customers like Notion, Linear, Shopify, and Snowflake. Our growth and retention metrics are best-in-class among our peers: we have tens of millions in ARR, growing >100% year over year, over 2500 customers, very low churn, and many years of runway. We’ll share more details once we meet, but you now probably have a good idea as to why we're hiring for this role 😅.\n\nWe’ve listed this role twice: as a Platform Engineer and Site Reliability Engineer – our team does both, and we are open to candidates who lean towards one or the other.\n\n\nABOUT THE ROLE AND HOW WE WORK\n\nHi 👋 I’m Colin https://uk.linkedin.com/in/colinhoweuk, Head of EMEA Engineering. I’ve spent a number of years leading engineering teams in startups, and that has always included being close to infrastructure teams - no matter what name they’ve worn (SRE, infrastructure, platform, etc). I’ve got my hands dirty building the initial infrastructure for startups and know the value a talented infrastructure engineer brings. The rigour, the discipline, the peace and quiet when everything just hums along.\n\nOur infrastructure is in a good place for now. Nothing is static. Ashby continues to grow rapidly, putting strain on our existing infrastructure. We’re always looking to give our customers more powerful hiring software, and building new product features often requires new pieces of infrastructure.\n\nHaving herded plenty of snowflakeservers in the past, I’ve learned there’s a better way. I (and Ashby) place a lot of value on code-as-infrastructure. As a Platform Engineer at Ashby, you’ll get to dive into scaling problems, add new capabilities to our platform, and think about how our entire team interacts with infrastructure. All our own engineers own their projects end-to-end and ship with minimal oversight. We don’t put roadblocks to ensure security when common sense will do and we don’t build processes like change management boards around the lowest common denominator. But with great power comes great responsibility: we handle personal and confidential data about some of the biggest decisions we ever make at work. As we grow, more and bigger customers rely on us to be reliable and secure and how we operate internally will need to evolve.\n\nWe’re at an inflection point where our ability to scale and deliver a seamless experience has a make-or-break impact – we have some of the fastest growing companies using our platform every day to hire hundreds of people per month. We need someone like you to make good decisions, debug thorny issues, and build us a future-proof platform that can withstand this scale. Our small but mighty infrastructure team has set up a secure and simple environment (we don’t believe in spinning up a new service unless necessary!) for our growing product team to build in. That’s where you come in: you, too, will own projects end-to-end and have an impact on core parts of the Ashby developer and user experience. For instance, you could work on:\n\n - Optimize our homegrown ultra-dynamic recruiting DSL-to-SQL compiler https://www.loom.com/share/32c0cc3eedf2450fb66a901b76186ce4, and create tools to help developers do so\n\n - Create automated guardrails for the security and privacy of our customer data\n\n - Help our developers ship features fast through canary deploys, gradual rollouts and feature flags, while keeping complexity manageable and reducing downtime\n\n - Work with the business and the engineering team to define SLOs and implement the corresponding SLIs.\n\n - Ensure all communication with external services supports retries and circuit-breakers.\n\n - Implement the infrastructure to support an event-driven architecture and data warehouse.\n\nWe’re looking for someone who can build systems that an engineer would like to work with: mature and boring but open-minded and approachable. We have to balance reliability with flexibility. Software and its availability are now mission critical to almost every working professional. To be in an SRE in today’s world, you have to be extremely comfortable evaluating risk, those you take and those others take.\n\n\nWHY YOU SHOULD OR SHOULDN’T APPLY\n\nYou should apply if:\n\n - You never stop. You get weirdly obsessed about a problem that doesn’t yet make sense, turn it every which way in your head until the explanation dawns. You’ll search every rock, inventory every clue, hunt every mismatch. We do that, too - together we’ll be armed with state-of-the-art monitoring tools and an impressive amount of data, and join you in the adventure.\n\n - You don’t take shortcuts. You’re speaking up for the future user, the edge case, the doomsday design. You know product engineers want to build it with you, and see them as allies, where you give them the power and knowledge to access greater things.\n\n - You’re someone who cares about what you do and the team you do it with, and want to work with others who do as well. You’ll be on interview panels choosing your next colleagues, and you’ll take that seriously. You only want to work with people who make you better, and want to make you better.\n\n - You’ve built infrastructure at a slightly later stage than Ashby is at - you know how to deal with millions of data points, have seen great (or not great) infrastructure make or break customer experience, and have automated everything from provisioning to monitoring and release process.\n\n - You’re a Swiss army knife (all nationalities welcome ;) ). You’ll get every hard problem the company faces. You’ll get to do infrastructure updates, security enforcements, database optimization, Kubernetes debugging, and digging through Typescript traces figuring out what doesn’t work. You probably don’t feel like an expert at at least some of that... and that appeals to you.\n\nAll that makes for a pretty specific kind of role, and the job isn’t to everyone’s tastes! You should not apply if:\n\n - You don’t want to make your own decisions on what is the best paved road to build for Ashby, and expect a lead or manager to make the final call on what that is. Our leads (and managers) give ample commentary and feedback on technical decisions and how they’re made, but you ship what you want to build and are accountable for it.\n\n - You hate SQL. We have a lot of features built around making the best out of data, and our platform engineers also sometimes dive into a gnarly report or advise engineers on a more performant data model to use.\n\n - You don’t want to code. Our SREs are some of our best software engineers and they are just as responsible for the application as the other engineering teams - albeit at a platform level. Reviewing code and submitting code changes will be part of your day to day.\n\n - Your primary mode of communicating best practices to engineers is live meetings. We’re a very async culture and written communication (and code) is how changes get made. As an Ashby SRE, you will need to share new tooling and best practices with engineers faster than your next meeting opportunity will take you.\n\n - You’ve never delivered a project, on your own, without someone prodding you for updates. We have no project or delivery managers to fill your calendar with busy work, but the flip side is you have to do your project management, seek the help you need to get unstuck and cut scope when it’s worthwhile.\n\n\nTECHNOLOGY STACK\n\nI’m sharing our tech stack with the caveat that we don’t require previous experience in it: TypeScript (frontend & backend), Node.js, React, Apollo GraphQL, Postgres, Redis.\n\nWe use Datadog and Sentry on 100% cloud-based (AWS) infra. We take developer experience and reliability seriously: all engineers are on call in a follow-the-sun model, and everyone contributes to developer tooling.\n\n\nWHAT WE’RE BUILDING\n\nAs engineers, we are used to tooling that makes us better at what we do. When we started Ashby, we saw the opposite with Talent Acquisition software. Recruiting teams were leveling up how they did their work, but instead of software meeting this new standard, it held them back.\n\nScheduling a final round is an excellent example. Recruiting teams wanted to schedule candidates faster, track interviewer preparation and quality, and do it with half the headcount. A recruiter needed to manually collect availability from the candidate, identify qualified interviewers, perform “Calendar Tetris” to find who is available to interview the candidate, schedule on the earliest date possible, and make any last-minute adjustments as availability changed. They must do this while considering the interview load on each individual and whether interviewers need to be trained and shadowing others. 🥵 TA software didn’t help.\n\nAs hiring managers, we know TA is a critical function, and as engineers, we know software can do better. So, we built and continue to build Ashby to give TA teams the highest standard of tooling. Software that’s intelligent and powerful. Software that provides insights into where they’re failing and automates or simplifies many of the tasks they’re underwater with. We want other functions and departments to be jealous of what TA teams can do with Ashby, and today they often are!\n\n\nENGINEERING CULTURE\n\nOur engineering culture is motivated by Abhik https://www.linkedin.com/in/abhikpramanik/ and Benji https://www.linkedin.com/in/benjaminencz/’s (our co-founders) belief that a small talented team, given the right environment, can build high-quality software fast (and work regular hours!). We do it through:\n\n - Minimal process with ownership over decisions normally made by product and design\n\n - Natural collaboration and deliberate communication\n\n - Investing in tools and abstractions that give us leverage\n\n - Putting effort into building a diverse team\n\n\nMINIMAL PROCESS & LOTS OF OWNERSHIP\n\nThe best engineers we’ve worked with delivered reliably magical outcomes. They took customer problems and relentlessly drove them to solutions that were not only successful but often brilliant and creative. While they did this with minimal oversight, stakeholders were never in the dark as to what was going on, and no setback was a surprise.\n\nTraditional product-development processes aren’t meant for the best engineers. Their purpose is to create consistent outcomes regardless of the engineer’s skill. But, consistency comes at the expense of an engineer’s time and freedom—both ingredients necessary to generate those magical outcomes. As a result, process stifles the best engineers and doesn’t give others the opportunity to practice the behaviors that made the best engineers the “best.”\n\nAt Ashby, we want to build an environment that encourages every engineer to be their best. So, at Ashby, every Engineer runs their project. Product Managers (and Designers) build strategy, do customer research, and hand off problem briefs to Engineers. Engineers take on the rest: they research the problem, write product specs, build wireframes, and implement their solution end-to-end. We rely on engineers, not process, to push information outward to the relevant folks (e.g., Product Managers) and pull folks in to help (e.g., Designers, Infra). It’s a new level of ownership for many engineers, but we’d rather an engineer fail a bit and coach up their skills than use process as a crutch. Not everyone succeeds in our culture, but those who do thrive.\n\n\nCOLLABORATION IS NATURAL & COMMUNICATION IS DELIBERATE\n\nOur engineering team consists of lifelong learners who are talented but also humble and kind (meet them here https://www.ashbyhq.com/team!). These attributes create an environment where collaboration happens naturally. We combine this with research, prototyping, and written proposals to see around corners and get feedback from the team across time zones. Focus time is something that we hold sacred, and, with thoughtful and deliberate communication, engineers are in <2h meetings per week (Abhik wrote about it here https://www.ashbyhq.com/blog/company/thoughtful-communication).\n\nTo drive it home, here's a recent calendar of an engineer who has been with us for over 4 years:\n\n[https://app.ashbyhq.com/api/images/user-content/4ea5f68e-c33e-4ac9-831a-e732bee4a303/d4679311-9dba-4031-bf5e-19ce78597ab1/calendar.png]\n\nWe also meet in person at least twice a year, once as a department and once as a company. You also have a small budget to meet up with folks in your city/region.\n\n\nINCREASE LEVERAGE, NOT TEAM SIZE\n\nWe built Ashby with the quality, breadth, and depth that many customers would expect from much larger teams over larger time scales. We’ve done this through investment in:\n\n - Great developer tooling. Our CI/CD takes ~10m, and we deploy at least 15x a day. A debugger that works out of the box. Everyone on the team has contributed to our developer experience 💪🏾.\n\n - Building blocks to create powerful and customizable products fast. At the core of Ashby is a set of common components (analytics modeling and query language, policy engine, workflow engine, design system) that we constantly improve. Each improvement to a common component cascades throughout our app (short video below).\n\nHere’s an impromptu quote from Arjun in our company Slack of what it’s like to build a feature at Ashby:\n\n[https://app.ashbyhq.com/api/images/user-content/4ea5f68e-c33e-4ac9-831a-e732bee4a303/8d94727a-46d8-42a2-9627-ddcd7f822f95/arjun.png]\n\nAnd a demo of one of these building blocks:\n\n\nPUT EFFORT INTO DIVERSITY\n\nDiverse teams drive innovation and better outcomes. Having seen my mother and partner build their careers as minority women in non-diverse fields, I want to make sure Ashby creates opportunities for the next generation of engineers from underrepresented groups.\n\nToday, 21% of engineers at Ashby are from underrepresented groups. It’s not great, and we are taking conscious steps to improve, like sourcing diverse candidates, providing generous paid family leave, no leetcode interviews, and more.\n\n\nINTERVIEW PROCESS\n\nAt Ashby, our team and interview process want to help you show your best self. We’ll dive into past projects and simulate working together via pair programming, writing product and tech specs collaboratively, and talking through decisions. There are no leetcode or whiteboard exercises.\n\nOur interview process is three rounds:\n\n 1. Introduction call with Hiring Manager (15 to 30m, live)\n\n 2. A technical screen where we pair in our actual codebase (1h, live)\n\n 3. Three non-coding interviews that focus on technical design, debugging incidents, and infrastructure (3h 15m, live can be split across multiple days)\n\nDepending on our leadership team’s bandwidth, we may start with an additional 30m screen with a recruiter.\n\nYour hiring manager will be your main point of contact and prep you for interviews.

            "descriptionHtml": "<p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We’re looking for a curious, rigorous, problem-hungry platform engineer (who codes!) to carry the ball as we bring Ashby to the big leagues. Ashby builds software that lets talent teams build an efficient, delightful, respectful hiring process. Similarly, you’re an engineer who wants to build a “paved road” that excellent engineering teams can safely take to the moon and back.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We have notable customers like Notion, Linear, Shopify, and Snowflake. Our growth and retention metrics are best-in-class among our peers: we have tens of millions in ARR, growing &gt;100% year over year, over 2500 customers, very low churn, and many years of runway. We’ll share more details once we meet, but you now probably have a good idea as to why we're hiring for this role 😅.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We’ve listed this role twice: as a Platform Engineer and Site Reliability Engineer – our team does both, and we are open to candidates who lean towards one or the other. </p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1>About the role and how we work</h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Hi 👋 I’m<a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://uk.linkedin.com/in/colinhoweuk\"> <u>Colin</u></a>, Head of EMEA Engineering. I’ve spent a number of years leading engineering teams in startups, and that has always included being close to infrastructure teams - no matter what name they’ve worn (SRE, infrastructure, platform, etc). I’ve got my hands dirty building the initial infrastructure for startups and know the value a talented infrastructure engineer brings. The rigour, the discipline, the peace and quiet when everything just <em>hums along</em>.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Our infrastructure is in a good place <em>for now</em>. Nothing is static. Ashby continues to grow rapidly, putting strain on our existing infrastructure. We’re always looking to give our customers more powerful hiring software, and building new product features often requires new pieces of infrastructure.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Having herded plenty of <em>snowflakeservers</em> in the past, I’ve learned there’s a better way. I (and Ashby) place a lot of value on code-as-infrastructure. As a Platform Engineer at Ashby, you’ll get to dive into scaling problems, add new capabilities to our platform, and think about how our entire team interacts with infrastructure. All our own engineers own their projects end-to-end and ship with minimal oversight. We don’t put roadblocks to ensure security when common sense will do and we don’t build processes like change management boards around the lowest common denominator. But with great power comes great responsibility: we handle personal and confidential data about some of the biggest decisions we ever make at work. As we grow, more and bigger customers rely on us to be reliable and secure and how we operate internally will need to evolve.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We’re at an inflection point where our ability to scale and deliver a seamless experience has a make-or-break impact – we have some of the fastest growing companies using our platform every day to hire hundreds of people per month. We need someone like you to make good decisions, debug thorny issues, and build us a future-proof platform that can withstand this scale. Our small but mighty infrastructure team has set up a secure and simple environment (we don’t believe in spinning up a new service unless necessary!) for our growing product team to build in.

You should not apply if:</p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You don’t want to make your own decisions on what is the best paved road to build for Ashby, and expect a lead or manager to make the final call on what that is. Our leads (and managers) give ample commentary and feedback on technical decisions and how they’re made, but you ship what you want to build and are accountable for it.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You hate SQL.

We take developer experience and reliability seriously: all engineers are on call in a follow-the-sun model, and everyone contributes to developer tooling.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1>What We’re Building</h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">As engineers, we are used to tooling that makes us <strong>better</strong> at what we do. When we started Ashby, we saw the opposite with Talent Acquisition software. Recruiting teams were leveling up how they did their work, but instead of software meeting this new standard, it held them back.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Scheduling a final round is an excellent example. Recruiting teams wanted to schedule candidates faster, track interviewer preparation and quality, and do it with half the headcount. A recruiter needed to manually collect availability from the candidate, identify qualified interviewers, perform “Calendar Tetris” to find who is available to interview the candidate, schedule on the earliest date possible, and make any last-minute adjustments as availability changed. They must do this while considering the interview load on each individual and whether interviewers need to be trained and shadowing others. 🥵 TA software didn’t help.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">As hiring managers, we know TA is a critical function, and as engineers, we know software can do better. So, we built and continue to build Ashby to give TA teams the <em>highest</em> standard of tooling. Software that’s intelligent and powerful. Software that provides insights into where they’re failing and automates or simplifies many of the tasks they’re underwater with. We want other functions and departments to be jealous of what TA teams can do with Ashby, and today they often are!</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1>Engineering Culture</h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Our engineering culture is motivated by <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/abhikpramanik/\"><u>Abhik</u></a> and <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/benjaminencz/\"><u>Benji</u></a>’s (our co-founders) belief that a small talented team, given the right environment, can build high-quality software fast (and work regular hours!). We do it through:</p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Minimal process with ownership over decisions normally made by product and design</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Natural collaboration and deliberate communication</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Investing in tools and abstractions that give us leverage</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Putting effort into building a diverse team</p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h2><strong>Minimal Process &amp; Lots of Ownership</strong></h2><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">The best engineers we’ve worked with delivered reliably magical outcomes. They took customer problems and relentlessly drove them to solutions that were not only successful but often brilliant and creative. While they did this with minimal oversight, stakeholders were never in the dark as to what was going on, and no setback was a surprise.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Traditional product-development processes aren’t meant for the best engineers. Their purpose is to create consistent outcomes regardless of the engineer’s skill. But, consistency comes at the expense of an engineer’s time and freedom—both ingredients necessary to generate those magical outcomes. As a result, process stifles the best engineers and doesn’t give others the opportunity to practice the behaviors that made the best engineers the “best.”</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">At Ashby, we want to build an environment that encourages every engineer to be their best. So, at Ashby, every Engineer runs their project. Product Managers (and Designers) build strategy, do customer research, and hand off problem briefs to Engineers. Engineers take on the rest: they research the problem, write product specs, build wireframes, and implement their solution end-to-end. We rely on engineers, not process, to push information outward to the relevant folks (e.g., Product Managers) and pull folks in to help (e.g., Designers, Infra). It’s a new level of ownership for many engineers, but we’d rather an engineer fail a bit and coach up their skills than use process as a crutch. Not everyone succeeds in our culture, but those who do <em>thrive</em>.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h2><strong>Collaboration is Natural &amp; Communication is Deliberate</strong></h2><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Our engineering team consists of lifelong learners who are talented but also humble and kind (meet them <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://www.ashbyhq.com/team\"><u>here</u></a>!). These attributes create an environment where collaboration happens naturally. We combine this with research, prototyping, and written proposals to see around corners and get feedback from the team across time zones. Focus time is something that we hold sacred, and, with thoughtful and deliberate communication, engineers are in &lt;2h meetings per week (Abhik wrote about it <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://www.ashbyhq.com/blog/company/thoughtful-communication\"><u>here</u></a>).</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">To drive it home, here's a recent calendar of an engineer who has been with us for over 4 years:</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><div style=\"text-align:left\"><img style=\"max-width:100%\" src=\"https://app.ashbyhq.com/api/images/user-content/4ea5f68e-c33e-4ac9-831a-e732bee4a303/d4679311-9dba-4031-bf5e-19ce78597ab1/calendar.png\" /></div><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We also meet in person at least twice a year, once as a department and once as a company. You also have a small budget to meet up with folks in your city/region.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h2><strong>Increase Leverage, not Team Size</strong></h2><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We built Ashby with the quality, breadth, and depth that many customers would expect from much larger teams over larger time scales. We’ve done this through investment in:</p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><strong>Great developer tooling.</strong> Our CI/CD takes ~10m, and we deploy at least 15x a day. A debugger that works out of the box. Everyone on the team has contributed to our developer experience 💪🏾.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><strong>Building blocks to create powerful and customizable products fast.</strong> At the core of Ashby is a set of common components (analytics modeling and query language, policy engine, workflow engine, design system) that we constantly improve. Each improvement to a common component cascades throughout our app (short video below).</p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Here’s an impromptu quote from Arjun in our company Slack of what it’s like to build a feature at Ashby:</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><div style=\"text-align:left\"><img style=\"max-width:100%\" src=\"https://app.ashbyhq.com/api/images/user-content/4ea5f68e-c33e-4ac9-831a-e732bee4a303/8d94727a-46d8-42a2-9627-ddcd7f822f95/arjun.png\" /></div><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">And a demo of one of these building blocks:</p><div><div style=\"left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:62.5%\"><iframe src=\"https://embedded-media.ashbyhq.com/embed/4ea5f68e-c33e-4ac9-831a-e732bee4a303/9a5f032d-c731-411e-98cf-261517156f01\" style=\"top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0\" allowfullscreen scrolling=\"no\" allow=\"encrypted-media *; picture-in-picture *;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-presentation\"></iframe></div></div><h2><strong>Put Effort into Diversity</strong></h2><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Diverse teams drive innovation and better outcomes. Having seen my mother and partner build their careers as minority women in non-diverse fields, I want to make sure Ashby creates opportunities for the next generation of engineers from underrepresented groups.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Today, 21% of engineers at Ashby are from underrepresented groups. It’s not great, and we are taking conscious steps to improve, like sourcing diverse candidates, providing generous paid family leave, no leetcode interviews, and more.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1>Interview Process</h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">At Ashby, our team and interview process want to help you show your best self. We’ll dive into past projects and simulate working together via pair programming, writing product and tech specs collaboratively, and talking through decisions. There are no leetcode or whiteboard exercises.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Our interview process is three rounds:</p><ol style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Introduction call with Hiring Manager (15 to 30m, live)</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">A technical screen where we pair in our actual codebase (1h, live)</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Three non-coding interviews that focus on technical design, debugging incidents, and infrastructure (3h 15m, live can be split across multiple days)</p></li></ol><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Depending on our leadership team’s bandwidth, we may start with an <em>additional</em> 30m screen with a recruiter.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Your hiring manager will be your main point of contact and prep you for interviews. Each round will have written guidance so you know what to expect (you’ll need minimal preparation). You’ll meet 4 to 6 people in engineering (with 5-15 minutes in each interview to ask them questions). If we don’t give an offer, we’ll provide feedback!</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1><strong>Your First Three Months at Ashby</strong></h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We want an exceptional onboarding experience for every new hire. At Ashby, your dev environment is set up with a single script, you push your first product change on day one, and you spend the rest of your time shipping product changes that give you a tour of our codebase and best practices. The product changes increase in scope and ambiguity from simple copy changes to the delivery of a prominent, impactful feature. Your manager will do a 30, 60, and 90-day review to give feedback and calibrate on how we work together.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">It’s a team effort to get you successfully onboarded; you’ll have a peer paired with you to answer questions, pair program, and check in often to see if you need help. The rest of the team will run training sessions on our culture, product, engineering process, and technical architecture.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1>Benefits</h1><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Competitive salary and equity.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">10-year exercise window for stock options. You shouldn’t feel pressure to purchase stock options if you leave Ashby —do it when you feel financially comfortable.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Unlimited PTO, and we will encourage you to take it.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">A minimum of 12 weeks of fully paid parental leave, covered by Ashby. For folks outside the US, it may be longer to be in line with regional requirements.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Generous equipment, software, and office furniture budget. Get what you need to be happy and productive!</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">$100/month education budget with more expensive items (like conferences) covered with manager approval.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">If you’re in the US, we offer top-tier health insurance for you and your dependents, with 100% of premiums covered by Ashby. In other countries, we provide high-quality supplemental health insurance for you and your dependents, also fully covered by us.</p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Ashby’s success hinges on hiring great people and creating an environment where we can be happy, feel challenged, and do our best work. We’re being deliberate about building that environment from the ground up. I hope that excites you enough to apply.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>Ashby provides equal employment opportunities (EEO) to all employees and applicants for employment without regard to race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability, genetics, sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression.

            "descriptionPlain": "We’re looking for a curious, rigorous, problem-hungry platform engineer (who codes!) to carry the ball as we bring Ashby to the big leagues. Ashby builds software that lets talent teams build an efficient, delightful, respectful hiring process. Similarly, you’re an engineer who wants to build a “paved road” that excellent engineering teams can safely take to the moon and back.\n\nWe have notable customers like Notion, Linear, Shopify, and Snowflake. Our growth and retention metrics are best-in-class among our peers: we have tens of millions in ARR, growing >100% year over year, over 2500 customers, very low churn, and many years of runway. We’ll share more details once we meet, but you now probably have a good idea as to why we're hiring for this role 😅.\n\nWe’ve listed this role twice: as a Platform Engineer and Site Reliability Engineer – our team does both, and we are open to candidates who lean towards one or the other.\n\n\nABOUT THE ROLE AND HOW WE WORK\n\nHi 👋 I’m Colin https://uk.linkedin.com/in/colinhoweuk, Head of EMEA Engineering. I’ve spent a number of years leading engineering teams in startups, and that has always included being close to infrastructure teams - no matter what name they’ve worn (SRE, infrastructure, platform, etc). I’ve got my hands dirty building the initial infrastructure for startups and know the value a talented infrastructure engineer brings. The rigour, the discipline, the peace and quiet when everything just hums along.\n\nOur infrastructure is in a good place for now. Nothing is static. Ashby continues to grow rapidly, putting strain on our existing infrastructure. We’re always looking to give our customers more powerful hiring software, and building new product features often requires new pieces of infrastructure.\n\nHaving herded plenty of snowflakeservers in the past, I’ve learned there’s a better way. I (and Ashby) place a lot of value on code-as-infrastructure. As a Platform Engineer at Ashby, you’ll get to dive into scaling problems, add new capabilities to our platform, and think about how our entire team interacts with infrastructure. All our own engineers own their projects end-to-end and ship with minimal oversight. We don’t put roadblocks to ensure security when common sense will do and we don’t build processes like change management boards around the lowest common denominator. But with great power comes great responsibility: we handle personal and confidential data about some of the biggest decisions we ever make at work. As we grow, more and bigger customers rely on us to be reliable and secure and how we operate internally will need to evolve.\n\nWe’re at an inflection point where our ability to scale and deliver a seamless experience has a make-or-break impact – we have some of the fastest growing companies using our platform every day to hire hundreds of people per month. We need someone like you to make good decisions, debug thorny issues, and build us a future-proof platform that can withstand this scale. Our small but mighty infrastructure team has set up a secure and simple environment (we don’t believe in spinning up a new service unless necessary!) for our growing product team to build in. That’s where you come in: you, too, will own projects end-to-end and have an impact on core parts of the Ashby developer and user experience. For instance, you could work on:\n\n - Optimize our homegrown ultra-dynamic recruiting DSL-to-SQL compiler https://www.loom.com/share/32c0cc3eedf2450fb66a901b76186ce4, and create tools to help developers do so\n\n - Create automated guardrails for the security and privacy of our customer data\n\n - Help our developers ship features fast through canary deploys, gradual rollouts and feature flags, while keeping complexity manageable and reducing downtime\n\n - Work with the business and the engineering team to define SLOs and implement the corresponding SLIs.\n\n - Ensure all communication with external services supports retries and circuit-breakers.\n\n - Implement the infrastructure to support an event-driven architecture and data warehouse.\n\nWe’re looking for someone who can build systems that an engineer would like to work with: mature and boring but open-minded and approachable. We have to balance reliability with flexibility. Software and its availability are now mission critical to almost every working professional. To be in an SRE in today’s world, you have to be extremely comfortable evaluating risk, those you take and those others take.\n\n\nWHY YOU SHOULD OR SHOULDN’T APPLY\n\nYou should apply if:\n\n - You never stop. You get weirdly obsessed about a problem that doesn’t yet make sense, turn it every which way in your head until the explanation dawns. You’ll search every rock, inventory every clue, hunt every mismatch. We do that, too - together we’ll be armed with state-of-the-art monitoring tools and an impressive amount of data, and join you in the adventure.\n\n - You don’t take shortcuts. You’re speaking up for the future user, the edge case, the doomsday design. You know product engineers want to build it with you, and see them as allies, where you give them the power and knowledge to access greater things.\n\n - You’re someone who cares about what you do and the team you do it with, and want to work with others who do as well. You’ll be on interview panels choosing your next colleagues, and you’ll take that seriously.

You’ll get every hard problem the company faces. You’ll get to do infrastructure updates, security enforcements, database optimization, Kubernetes debugging, and digging through Typescript traces figuring out what doesn’t work. You probably don’t feel like an expert at at least some of that... and that appeals to you.\n\nAll that makes for a pretty specific kind of role, and the job isn’t to everyone’s tastes! You should not apply if:\n\n - You don’t want to make your own decisions on what is the best paved road to build for Ashby, and expect a lead or manager to make the final call on what that is. Our leads (and managers) give ample commentary and feedback on technical decisions and how they’re made, but you ship what you want to build and are accountable for it.\n\n - You hate SQL.

Each improvement to a common component cascades throughout our app (short video below).\n\nHere’s an impromptu quote from Arjun in our company Slack of what it’s like to build a feature at Ashby:\n\n[https://app.ashbyhq.com/api/images/user-content/4ea5f68e-c33e-4ac9-831a-e732bee4a303/8d94727a-46d8-42a2-9627-ddcd7f822f95/arjun.png]\n\nAnd a demo of one of these building blocks:\n\n\nPUT EFFORT INTO DIVERSITY\n\nDiverse teams drive innovation and better outcomes. Having seen my mother and partner build their careers as minority women in non-diverse fields, I want to make sure Ashby creates opportunities for the next generation of engineers from underrepresented groups.\n\nToday, 21% of engineers at Ashby are from underrepresented groups. It’s not great, and we are taking conscious steps to improve, like sourcing diverse candidates, providing generous paid family leave, no leetcode interviews, and more.\n\n\nINTERVIEW PROCESS\n\nAt Ashby, our team and interview process want to help you show your best self. We’ll dive into past projects and simulate working together via pair programming, writing product and tech specs collaboratively, and talking through decisions. There are no leetcode or whiteboard exercises.\n\nOur interview process is three rounds:\n\n 1. Introduction call with Hiring Manager (15 to 30m, live)\n\n 2. A technical screen where we pair in our actual codebase (1h, live)\n\n 3. Three non-coding interviews that focus on technical design, debugging incidents, and infrastructure (3h 15m, live can be split across multiple days)\n\nDepending on our leadership team’s bandwidth, we may start with an additional 30m screen with a recruiter.\n\nYour hiring manager will be your main point of contact and prep you for interviews. Each round will have written guidance so you know what to expect (you’ll need minimal preparation). You’ll meet 4 to 6 people in engineering (with 5-15 minutes in each interview to ask them questions). If we don’t give an offer, we’ll provide feedback!\n\n\nYOUR FIRST THREE MONTHS AT ASHBY\n\nWe want an exceptional onboarding experience for every new hire. At Ashby, your dev environment is set up with a single script, you push your first product change on day one, and you spend the rest of your time shipping product changes that give you a tour of our codebase and best practices. The product changes increase in scope and ambiguity from simple copy changes to the delivery of a prominent, impactful feature. Your manager will do a 30, 60, and 90-day review to give feedback and calibrate on how we work together.\n\nIt’s a team effort to get you successfully onboarded; you’ll have a peer paired with you to answer questions, pair program, and check in often to see if you need help. The rest of the team will run training sessions on our culture, product, engineering process, and technical architecture.\n\n\nBENEFITS\n\n - Competitive salary and equity.\n\n - 10-year exercise window for stock options. You shouldn’t feel pressure to purchase stock options if you leave Ashby —do it when you feel financially comfortable.\n\n - Unlimited PTO, and we will encourage you to take it.\n\n - A minimum of 12 weeks of fully paid parental leave, covered by Ashby. For folks outside the US, it may be longer to be in line with regional requirements.\n\n - Generous equipment, software, and office furniture budget. Get what you need to be happy and productive!\n\n - $100/month education budget with more expensive items (like conferences) covered with manager approval.\n\n - If you’re in the US, we offer top-tier health insurance for you and your dependents, with 100% of premiums covered by Ashby. In other countries, we provide high-quality supplemental health insurance for you and your dependents, also fully covered by us.\n\nAshby’s success hinges on hiring great people and creating an environment where we can be happy, feel challenged, and do our best work. We’re being deliberate about building that environment from the ground up. I hope that excites you enough to apply.\n\nAshby provides equal employment opportunities (EEO) to all employees and applicants for employment without regard to race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability, genetics, sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression. We are committed to a diverse and inclusive workforce and welcome people from all backgrounds, experiences, perspectives, and abilities.",

As someone who could design and build software, this position is close to my heart. I always felt I had a unique perspective because I could play with design ideas and iterate <em>in code</em>. My ideas could start in Figma but then be grounded (or sometimes more creative) in code. My prototypes used actual logic and data. My changes cascaded throughout the app for comprehensive critique (thanks, React component system!). But, every company made me pick one —I couldn’t design <em>and </em>build. At Ashby, you can.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">While every engineer can design <em>and </em>build, you’ll tackle our most challenging design problems and help others improve their designs by expanding and enhancing our in-house design system and consulting on bespoke work. To ground it with examples, engineers who can design at Ashby have:</p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Redesigned our mobile web app by talking with customers who use it often, wireframing new flows, implementing its design system, and using it to make the wireframes a reality.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Built a set of flexible, composable components in our design system that allow other engineers to build custom autocompletes. These autocompletes can contain filters, options to create new records, etc.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Helped another engineer improve their design's information hierarchy and scannability for viewing a candidate’s assessments. Recruiters can quickly parse information and pick out anomalies.</p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">These projects reflect what we’re accomplishing at Ashby: improving the productivity of working professionals (starting with talent teams) with intelligent and powerful software. We put a lot of effort into designing products that are approachable to beginners but mastered &amp; extended by power users. In many ways, spreadsheets set the bar here.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We have many customers, great revenue growth, years of runway, and amazing investors like YCombinator, Elad Gil, and Lachy Groom. I’ll share more once we meet.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><strong>This is a staff-level role, so we require at least 5 years of experience as a full-time frontend engineer or evenly split between frontend and design for this role and significant contributions to (or leading) design systems.</strong></p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1>Engineering Culture</h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Our engineering culture is motivated by <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/benjaminencz/\"><u>Benji</u></a>’s (my co-founder and CEO) and my belief that a small talented team, given the right environment, can build high-quality software fast (and work regular hours!).</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h2>Collaboration is Natural &amp; Communication is Deliberate</h2><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Our engineering team (and the team at large) consists of lifelong learners who are humble and kind (meet them <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://www.ashbyhq.com/team\"><u>here</u></a>!). These attributes create an environment where collaboration happens naturally (we filter for it in interviews). We combine this with research, prototyping, and written proposals to see around corners and get feedback from the team across time zones. Focus time is something that we hold sacred, and, with thoughtful and deliberate communication, engineers spend less than 4 hours per week in meetings (I wrote about it <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://www.ashbyhq.com/blog/company/thoughtful-communication\"><u>here</u></a>). </p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h2>Increase Leverage, not Team Size</h2><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We built Ashby with the quality, breadth, and depth that many customers would expect from much larger teams over larger time scales. We’ve done this through investment in:</p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><strong>Great developer tooling.</strong> Our CI/CD takes ~10m, and we deploy at least 10x a day. Everyone on the team has contributed to developer experience 💪🏾</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><strong>Building blocks to create powerful and customizable products fast. </strong>At the core of Ashby is a set of common components (analytics modeling and query language, policy engine, workflow engine, design system) which we are constantly improving. Each improvement to a common component cascades throughout our app (short video below).</p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Here’s an impromptu quote from Arjun in our company Slack of what it’s like to build a feature at Ashby:</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><div style=\"text-align:left\"><img style=\"max-width:100%\" src=\"https://app.ashbyhq.com/api/images/user-content/4ea5f68e-c33e-4ac9-831a-e732bee4a303/8d94727a-46d8-42a2-9627-ddcd7f822f95/arjun.png\" /></div><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">And a demo of one of these building blocks:</p><div><div style=\"left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:62.5%\"><iframe src=\"https://embedded-media.ashbyhq.com/embed/4ea5f68e-c33e-4ac9-831a-e732bee4a303/51f566eb-0674-498e-afcc-cb4b70f281a0\" style=\"top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0\" allowfullscreen scrolling=\"no\" allow=\"encrypted-media *; picture-in-picture *;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-presentation\"></iframe></div></div><h2>Give Engineers Ownership &amp; Autonomy</h2><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We, as engineers, find clever ways to solve problems, which amplifies when we deeply understand the problem. Benji and I did our best work as engineers when we had a deep understanding of the end-user and the business and ownership over the solution. Our engineering culture reflects this experience: engineers own projects end-to-end, from speaking with users to writing product specs to UX design. These are skills that we often don’t get to practice as engineers, and, at Ashby, we provide mentorship to grow them and help from the team where you want it.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h2>Put Effort into Diversity </h2><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Diverse teams <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://hbr.org/2016/11/why-diverse-teams-are-smarter\"><u>drive innovation and better outcomes</u></a>.

We’ll dive into past projects and simulate working together via pair programming, writing tech specs collaboratively, and talking through decisions (no leetcode or whiteboard exercises). Our interview process is three rounds with some casual Zoom (or in-person) coffee in between to get to know each other: </p><ol style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">30-minute introduction call to discuss Ashby and your past work (we demo Ashby!)</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">A technical screen (take home <em>or, </em>for more experienced folks who want it, a 90-minute live session)</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">A virtual on-site of 3 hours and 45 minutes (can be split across two days) </p></li></ol><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Your hiring manager will be your main point of contact and prepare you for interviews. You’ll meet other engineering leaders and 4 to 6 engineers (with 15 minutes in each interview to ask them questions). If we don’t give an offer, we’ll provide feedback!</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1>Your First Two Months at Ashby</h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We want an exceptional onboarding experience for every new hire. At Ashby, your dev environment sets up with a single script, you push your first change on day one, and we spend the rest of the time building your confidence in our codebase and practices culminating in delivering a prominent, impactful feature. We’ll pair you with a peer who’ll guide you through your first tasks and be someone you rely on, from answering questions to pair programming.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1>Technology Stack</h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Our tech stack is TypeScript (frontend &amp; backend), React, a mix of SASS modules and Stitches, Apollo GraphQL, Node.js, Postgres, and Redis.

At Ashby, you can.\n\nWhile every engineer can design and build, you’ll tackle our most challenging design problems and help others improve their designs by expanding and enhancing our in-house design system and consulting on bespoke work. To ground it with examples, engineers who can design at Ashby have:\n\n - Redesigned our mobile web app by talking with customers who use it often, wireframing new flows, implementing its design system, and using it to make the wireframes a reality.\n\n - Built a set of flexible, composable components in our design system that allow other engineers to build custom autocompletes. These autocompletes can contain filters, options to create new records, etc.\n\n - Helped another engineer improve their design's information hierarchy and scannability for viewing a candidate’s assessments. Recruiters can quickly parse information and pick out anomalies.\n\nThese projects reflect what we’re accomplishing at Ashby: improving the productivity of working professionals (starting with talent teams) with intelligent and powerful software. We put a lot of effort into designing products that are approachable to beginners but mastered & extended by power users. In many ways, spreadsheets set the bar here.\n\nWe have many customers, great revenue growth, years of runway, and amazing investors like YCombinator, Elad Gil, and Lachy Groom. I’ll share more once we meet.\n\nThis is a staff-level role, so we require at least 5 years of experience as a full-time frontend engineer or evenly split between frontend and design for this role and significant contributions to (or leading) design systems.\n\n\nENGINEERING CULTURE\n\nOur engineering culture is motivated by Benji https://www.linkedin.com/in/benjaminencz/’s (my co-founder and CEO) and my belief that a small talented team, given the right environment, can build high-quality software fast (and work regular hours!).\n\n\nCOLLABORATION IS NATURAL & COMMUNICATION IS DELIBERATE\n\nOur engineering team (and the team at large) consists of lifelong learners who are humble and kind (meet them here https://www.ashbyhq.com/team!). These attributes create an environment where collaboration happens naturally (we filter for it in interviews). We combine this with research, prototyping, and written proposals to see around corners and get feedback from the team across time zones. Focus time is something that we hold sacred, and, with thoughtful and deliberate communication, engineers spend less than 4 hours per week in meetings (I wrote about it here https://www.ashbyhq.com/blog/company/thoughtful-communication). \n\n\nINCREASE LEVERAGE, NOT TEAM SIZE\n\nWe built Ashby with the quality, breadth, and depth that many customers would expect from much larger teams over larger time scales. We’ve done this through investment in:\n\n - Great developer tooling. Our CI/CD takes ~10m, and we deploy at least 10x a day. Everyone on the team has contributed to developer experience 💪🏾\n\n - Building blocks to create powerful and customizable products fast. At the core of Ashby is a set of common components (analytics modeling and query language, policy engine, workflow engine, design system) which we are constantly improving. Each improvement to a common component cascades throughout our app (short video below).\n\nHere’s an impromptu quote from Arjun in our company Slack of what it’s like to build a feature at Ashby:\n\n[https://app.ashbyhq.com/api/images/user-content/4ea5f68e-c33e-4ac9-831a-e732bee4a303/8d94727a-46d8-42a2-9627-ddcd7f822f95/arjun.png]\n\nAnd a demo of one of these building blocks:\n\n\nGIVE ENGINEERS OWNERSHIP & AUTONOMY\n\nWe, as engineers, find clever ways to solve problems, which amplifies when we deeply understand the problem. Benji and I did our best work as engineers when we had a deep understanding of the end-user and the business and ownership over the solution. Our engineering culture reflects this experience: engineers own projects end-to-end, from speaking with users to writing product specs to UX design. These are skills that we often don’t get to practice as engineers, and, at Ashby, we provide mentorship to grow them and help from the team where you want it.\n\n\nPUT EFFORT INTO DIVERSITY \n\nDiverse teams drive innovation and better outcomes https://hbr.org/2016/11/why-diverse-teams-are-smarter. Having seen my mother and partner build their careers as minority women in non-diverse fields, I want to make sure Ashby creates opportunities for the next generation of engineers from underrepresented groups (including my daughter!).\n\nToday, 26% of engineers at Ashby are from underrepresented groups. It’s not great, and we are taking conscious steps to improve, like sourcing diverse candidates, providing generous paid family leave, no leetcode interviews, and more.\n\n\nINTERVIEW PROCESS\n\nAt Ashby, our team and interview process want to help you show your best self. We’ll dive into past projects and simulate working together via pair programming, writing tech specs collaboratively, and talking through decisions (no leetcode or whiteboard exercises). Our interview process is three rounds with some casual Zoom (or in-person) coffee in between to get to know each other: \n\n 1. 30-minute introduction call to discuss Ashby and your past work (we demo Ashby!)\n\n 2. A technical screen (take home or, for more experienced folks who want it, a 90-minute live session)\n\n 3. A virtual on-site of 3 hours and 45 minutes (can be split across two days) \n\nYour hiring manager will be your main point of contact and prepare you for interviews. You’ll meet other engineering leaders and 4 to 6 engineers (with 15 minutes in each interview to ask them questions). If we don’t give an offer, we’ll provide feedback!\n\n\nYOUR FIRST TWO MONTHS AT ASHBY\n\nWe want an exceptional onboarding experience for every new hire. At Ashby, your dev environment sets up with a single script, you push your first change on day one, and we spend the rest of the time building your confidence in our codebase and practices culminating in delivering a prominent, impactful feature. We’ll pair you with a peer who’ll guide you through your first tasks and be someone you rely on, from answering questions to pair programming.\n\n\nTECHNOLOGY STACK\n\nOur tech stack is TypeScript (frontend & backend), React, a mix of SASS modules and Stitches, Apollo GraphQL, Node.js, Postgres, and Redis. We're looking for folks with deep React, CSS, and HTML knowledge for this role.\n\n\nBENEFITS\n\n - Competitive salary and equity.\n\n - 10-year exercise window for stock options. You shouldn’t feel pressure to purchase stock options if you leave Ashby —do it when you feel financially comfortable.\n\n - Unlimited PTO with four weeks recommended per year. Expect “Vacation?” in our one-on-one agenda until you start taking it 😅.\n\n - Twelve weeks of fully paid family leave in the US. We plan to expand this to employees in other countries as situations arise.\n\n - Generous equipment, software, and office furniture budget. Get what you need to be happy and productive!\n\n - $100/month education budget with more expensive items (like conferences) covered with manager approval.\n\n - If you’re in the US, top-notch health insurance for you and your dependents with all premiums covered by us.\n\nAshby’s success hinges on hiring great people and creating an environment where we can be happy, feel challenged, and do our best work. We’re being deliberate about building that environment from the ground up. I hope that excites you enough to apply.\n\nAshby provides equal employment opportunities (EEO) to all employees and applicants for employment without regard to race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability, genetics, sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression. We are committed to a diverse and inclusive workforce and welcome people from all backgrounds, experiences, perspectives, and abilities.",

            "descriptionHtml": "<p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Hello! I’m Jared 👋 I joined Ashby three years ago as the first member of the Startup Customer Success team. Since then, I have been a part of building out the onboarding and success functions across our entire startup segment. Today, we’re a team of nine spanning across the US, Canada, and EMEA. I am so excited to be hiring another <strong>Startup Customer Success Manager </strong>in the US or Canada 🎉.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><br />Our <strong>Startup Customer Success Team</strong> serves our early-stage customers programmatically. These customers are special to us because they aren’t just learning our software; they are learning how to build hiring excellence into the DNA of their growing organizations.<br /><br />Our <strong>Startup Customer Success Managers</strong> create high-quality onboarding materials, documentation, and e-webinars that enable our customers to get up and running independently. They also jump in to assist via email and customer calls when needed. This is a mid-level role, so we require at least 2 years of experience as a full-time Startup Customer Success Manager, Account Manager, or Program Manager. <br /><br />In this role, you’ll take ownership of a book of customers for whom you’d be the main point of contact in our shared inbox and hop on customer calls per our SLAs. You’ll also take ownership of medium and large projects that are core to our team’s operations. Existing projects our team has taken on include:</p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Building an in-app onboarding experience using CommandAI</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Creation of a live, foundational webinar series + recorded content</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Building retention best practices into our engagement with customers that extend well beyond just onboarding</p></li></ul><h2>You should apply if:</h2><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You have 2+ years of customer-facing experience supporting a complex and rapidly evolving product (for complexity, think tools like Zapier, HubSpot, and Acuity Scheduling) OR have Recruiting/Recruiting Operations experience as an Ashby user.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You enjoy becoming a subject matter and product expert to help deliver excellent experiences when assisting our customers in solving complex challenges. Oftentimes, there will be multiple solutions to any given challenge and you enjoy getting in the weeds with customers to figure out what exactly they need to suggest the best path forward.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You’re skilled at defining the scope of problems and creating comprehensive solutions independently and collaboratively. With a complex product comes complex problems - you are excellent at identifying an issue, mapping multiple paths forward, and taking action based on principled thinking.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You possess keen attention to detail, ensuring your email and live responses are thorough, clear, and empathetic along the way. Solving the problem is sometimes only half the battle - you are gifted in extracting only the necessary details that our customers or our team members need to solve a problem.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You have strong written and verbal communication skills.

            "descriptionPlain": "Hello! I’m Jared 👋 I joined Ashby three years ago as the first member of the Startup Customer Success team. Since then, I have been a part of building out the onboarding and success functions across our entire startup segment. Today, we’re a team of nine spanning across the US, Canada, and EMEA. I am so excited to be hiring another Startup Customer Success Manager in the US or Canada 🎉.\n\n\nOur Startup Customer Success Team serves our early-stage customers programmatically. These customers are special to us because they aren’t just learning our software; they are learning how to build hiring excellence into the DNA of their growing organizations.\n\nOur Startup Customer Success Managers create high-quality onboarding materials, documentation, and e-webinars that enable our customers to get up and running independently. They also jump in to assist via email and customer calls when needed. This is a mid-level role, so we require at least 2 years of experience as a full-time Startup Customer Success Manager, Account Manager, or Program Manager.\n\nIn this role, you’ll take ownership of a book of customers for whom you’d be the main point of contact in our shared inbox and hop on customer calls per our SLAs. You’ll also take ownership of medium and large projects that are core to our team’s operations. Existing projects our team has taken on include:\n\n - Building an in-app onboarding experience using CommandAI\n\n - Creation of a live, foundational webinar series + recorded content\n\n - Building retention best practices into our engagement with customers that extend well beyond just onboarding\n\n\nYOU SHOULD APPLY IF:\n\n - You have 2+ years of customer-facing experience supporting a complex and rapidly evolving product (for complexity, think tools like Zapier, HubSpot, and Acuity Scheduling) OR have Recruiting/Recruiting Operations experience as an Ashby user.\n\n - You enjoy becoming a subject matter and product expert to help deliver excellent experiences when assisting our customers in solving complex challenges. Oftentimes, there will be multiple solutions to any given challenge and you enjoy getting in the weeds with customers to figure out what exactly they need to suggest the best path forward.\n\n - You’re skilled at defining the scope of problems and creating comprehensive solutions independently and collaboratively. With a complex product comes complex problems - you are excellent at identifying an issue, mapping multiple paths forward, and taking action based on principled thinking.\n\n - You possess keen attention to detail, ensuring your email and live responses are thorough, clear, and empathetic along the way. Solving the problem is sometimes only half the battle - you are gifted in extracting only the necessary details that our customers or our team members need to solve a problem.\n\n - You have strong written and verbal communication skills. You effectively communicate with diverse user groups, whether partnering with an experienced TA leader developing the recruiting function at a Series A startup or instructing individuals who are new to recruiting SaaS tools.\n\n - You are curious—both in addressing customers and creating solutions that improve our workflows. You seek the answers beyond what’s on the surface. Sometimes an answer to a problem may not be obvious at surface level, but you enjoy digging into customer use cases to learn more about their process so you can suggest the best path(s) forward.\n\n\nYOU SHOULD NOT APPLY IF:\n\n - You’d prefer to work one-on-one with a small book of customers. The Startup CS Team at Ashby uses a pooled approach (1:many) to allow us to be agile in customer interactions and ensure they have access to the resources they need when they need them.\n\n - You feel like the customer journey ends once a customer is onboarded.

Since then, I’ve worked across RevOps and Customer Marketing at Procore and Meta, partnering with incredible teams to bring differentiated products to market. I first heard of Ashby through our Head of Content, <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/anumhussain/\"><u>Anum</u></a> with whom I’d spent those early days at HubSpot, and was inspired by the level of <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://www.ashbyhq.com/blog/culture/thoughtful-communication\"><u>thoughtfulness</u></a> and <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://www.ashbyhq.com/blog/culture/ashbys-operating-principles\"><u>operating principles</u></a> I saw and read about. I joined Ashby in April of 2024 - bringing all these experiences together to help build a thoughtful, high-impact Product Marketing team.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We’re a small, tight-knit team - and we’re just getting started 🚀 We work closely with Product, Solutions Engineering, Customer Success, Sales, and every level of leadership, including closely with our CEO <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/benjaminencz/\"><u>Benji</u></a>. We’re seen as strategic partners, not a service desk. PMM at Ashby means influence, visibility, and ownership - and this role is a chance to get in early on a team with strong internal momentum at a company growing fast.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We value technical curiosity, editorial clarity, and first-principles thinking. We avoid jargon, favor plain English, and aim to genuinely help customers understand what our product does and how it can help them. You don’t need a decade in PMM to succeed here - but you <em>do</em> need strong product instincts, clear writing, and a bias for building systems that scale.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h3><strong>About this Role</strong></h3><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We’re looking for a <strong>Senior Product Marketing Manager </strong>to focus specifically on <strong>new products.</strong></p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><strong>You’ll help bring brand-new products to life, setting the foundation for how we define, position, and grow them from day one.</strong></p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We’re a small, high-impact team helping build a best-in-class go-to-market engine. You’ll be joining during a pivotal phase as Ashby expands into a multi-product platform.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">This is <strong>not</strong> a feature launch or SKU expansion role. This is a <strong>foundational PMM</strong> role where you’ll work directly with partners across Product, Sales, and Services to launch new product lines.

            "descriptionPlain": "Hi 👋 I’m Rosalia https://www.linkedin.com/in/rosaliacefalu/, and I look after our Product Marketing team at Ashby.\n\nI started my career in Product Marketing and helped build the Sales Enablement function at HubSpot during its journey from startup to IPO. Since then, I’ve worked across RevOps and Customer Marketing at Procore and Meta, partnering with incredible teams to bring differentiated products to market. I first heard of Ashby through our Head of Content, Anum https://www.linkedin.com/in/anumhussain/ with whom I’d spent those early days at HubSpot, and was inspired by the level of thoughtfulness https://www.ashbyhq.com/blog/culture/thoughtful-communication and operating principles https://www.ashbyhq.com/blog/culture/ashbys-operating-principles I saw and read about. I joined Ashby in April of 2024 - bringing all these experiences together to help build a thoughtful, high-impact Product Marketing team.\n\nWe’re a small, tight-knit team - and we’re just getting started 🚀 We work closely with Product, Solutions Engineering, Customer Success, Sales, and every level of leadership, including closely with our CEO Benji https://www.linkedin.com/in/benjaminencz/. We’re seen as strategic partners, not a service desk. PMM at Ashby means influence, visibility, and ownership - and this role is a chance to get in early on a team with strong internal momentum at a company growing fast.\n\nWe value technical curiosity, editorial clarity, and first-principles thinking. We avoid jargon, favor plain English, and aim to genuinely help customers understand what our product does and how it can help them. You don’t need a decade in PMM to succeed here - but you do need strong product instincts, clear writing, and a bias for building systems that scale.\n\n\nABOUT THIS ROLE\n\nWe’re looking for a Senior Product Marketing Manager to focus specifically on new products.\n\nYou’ll help bring brand-new products to life, setting the foundation for how we define, position, and grow them from day one.\n\nWe’re a small, high-impact team helping build a best-in-class go-to-market engine. You’ll be joining during a pivotal phase as Ashby expands into a multi-product platform.\n\nThis is not a feature launch or SKU expansion role. This is a foundational PMM role where you’ll work directly with partners across Product, Sales, and Services to launch new product lines. You’ll sit at the intersection of product definition, audience development, and early go-to-market strategy.\n\nYou will be operating as a “startup within a startup,” where you’ll have access to the resources, skills and product acumen you usually get from a more established scale-up, while moving quickly and working with early adopters to establish product-market fit.\n\nIf you’re a product marketer who thrives in ambiguity, loves zero-to-one challenges, and wants to shape the future of Ashby’s next chapters, this is the role for you.\n\n\nYOUR BACKGROUND\n\nThere is not a single background that is the perfect fit for this role.

You will work with customers with varying levels of integration sophistication advising on integration best practices, technical configurations, and working with a customer’s internal expert on how to best achieve their goals. You will use your existing knowledge of both integrations and the products we will be integrating with to consult with our customers, helping them get up and running swiftly with Ashby, so they can ultimately achieve their desired business outcomes.

            "descriptionHtml": "<p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Hi! 👋 I'm <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/chkrlee/\">Chris</a>, head of Product Design at Ashby.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We're looking for a versatile, intrinsically motivated designer who is excited to contribute to rethinking how modern software is designed. At Ashby, you'll be part designer, part product manager, part consultant, and part design system manager (or some combination of the 4!). We do design differently here, and if that excites you, read on.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Our unique approach is working - we're growing &gt;100% year-over-year and have notable customers like Notion, Linear, Shopify, and Snowflake. Our growth and retention metrics are best-in-class among our peers: we have tens of millions in ARR, very low churn, and many years of runway. We're backed by amazing investors like Y Combinator, Elad Gil, Lachy Groom, and many more! We’ll share more details once we meet.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1>How We Work</h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">In my previous roles, product teams always consisted of a product manager, a designer, and ~4-5 engineers. This may sound familiar to you! The product manager briefs the designer who then designs. After designing, mocks are handed to the engineers. <br /><br />We take a more principled approach here at Ashby. If you've been designing software enough, you'll realize in actuality, design is required in varying degrees on each project. Sometimes in the past, I'd be asked to design yet another settings page, when really all that was needed was an engineer to reuse existing components and just follow some documentation I had written. Other times, I felt I should effectively be the product manager and own a project from beginning to end. In these latter cases, it made sense that I was even the one providing project updates and managing resources rather than constantly being pinged by a separate product manager.<br /><br />This principled approach is now what we do here, and it is part of what has allowed Ashby to take down incumbents in multiple verticals all at once. We don't settle for the status quo—we actively resist reversion to the mean.<br /><br />Currently, I report to Benji, the co-founder &amp; CEO. Both Abhik and Benji (our founders) care deeply about design, which at first glance may seem counterintuitive given the number of full-time designers that we employ. The belief is not that design is unimportant, but rather that it should be owned by the product team collectively, not solely by a group of full-time designers who happen to have the job title. <br /><br />The design <em><strong>department’s</strong></em> job at Ashby is not to make every single design decision but to equip our entire product team to make better decisions themselves, as well as edit decisions that PMs/Engineers choose to make. That, while tackling the biggest design challenges ourselves. </p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Separate from design, you may also be excited by the fact that we maintain a near seed-stage-like culture with fuzzy lines between functional roles, as much autonomy as you can handle, and a focus on IC-work with an almost-no-meeting culture. While you get the product-market fit and scale of a growth-stage startup, you also get the agency and no-nonsense, no-red-tape culture of a seed-stage startup.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1>What We’re Building</h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Talent teams aspire to build a hiring process that identifies great candidates, moves them quickly through the interview process, and provides an excellent experience for the candidate. To accomplish this, recruiters perform thousands of daily tasks to coordinate and relay information between candidates, interviewers, and hiring managers. Teams struggle to keep up!</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Scheduling a final round is an excellent example of our customers' challenges. A recruiter needs to collect availability from the candidate, identify potential interviewers, perform “Calendar Tetris” to find who is available to interview the candidate, schedule on the earliest date possible, and perform any last-minute adjustments as availability changes. They must perform this while considering the interview load on each individual and whether interviewers need to be trained and shadowing others. </p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Ashby provides talent teams with intelligent and powerful software that provides insights into where they’re failing and automates or simplifies many of the tasks they’re underwater with. We put a lot of effort into designing products that are approachable to beginners but mastered and extended by power users.

            "descriptionPlain": "Hi! 👋 I'm Chris https://www.linkedin.com/in/chkrlee/, head of Product Design at Ashby.\n\nWe're looking for a versatile, intrinsically motivated designer who is excited to contribute to rethinking how modern software is designed. At Ashby, you'll be part designer, part product manager, part consultant, and part design system manager (or some combination of the 4!). We do design differently here, and if that excites you, read on.\n\nOur unique approach is working - we're growing >100% year-over-year and have notable customers like Notion, Linear, Shopify, and Snowflake. Our growth and retention metrics are best-in-class among our peers: we have tens of millions in ARR, very low churn, and many years of runway. We're backed by amazing investors like Y Combinator, Elad Gil, Lachy Groom, and many more! We’ll share more details once we meet.\n\n\nHOW WE WORK\n\nIn my previous roles, product teams always consisted of a product manager, a designer, and ~4-5 engineers. This may sound familiar to you! The product manager briefs the designer who then designs. After designing, mocks are handed to the engineers.\n\nWe take a more principled approach here at Ashby. If you've been designing software enough, you'll realize in actuality, design is required in varying degrees on each project. Sometimes in the past, I'd be asked to design yet another settings page, when really all that was needed was an engineer to reuse existing components and just follow some documentation I had written. Other times, I felt I should effectively be the product manager and own a project from beginning to end. In these latter cases, it made sense that I was even the one providing project updates and managing resources rather than constantly being pinged by a separate product manager.\n\nThis principled approach is now what we do here, and it is part of what has allowed Ashby to take down incumbents in multiple verticals all at once. We don't settle for the status quo—we actively resist reversion to the mean.\n\nCurrently, I report to Benji, the co-founder & CEO. Both Abhik and Benji (our founders) care deeply about design, which at first glance may seem counterintuitive given the number of full-time designers that we employ. The belief is not that design is unimportant, but rather that it should be owned by the product team collectively, not solely by a group of full-time designers who happen to have the job title.\n\nThe design department’s job at Ashby is not to make every single design decision but to equip our entire product team to make better decisions themselves, as well as edit decisions that PMs/Engineers choose to make. That, while tackling the biggest design challenges ourselves.\n\nSeparate from design, you may also be excited by the fact that we maintain a near seed-stage-like culture with fuzzy lines between functional roles, as much autonomy as you can handle, and a focus on IC-work with an almost-no-meeting culture. While you get the product-market fit and scale of a growth-stage startup, you also get the agency and no-nonsense, no-red-tape culture of a seed-stage startup.\n\n\nWHAT WE’RE BUILDING\n\nTalent teams aspire to build a hiring process that identifies great candidates, moves them quickly through the interview process, and provides an excellent experience for the candidate. To accomplish this, recruiters perform thousands of daily tasks to coordinate and relay information between candidates, interviewers, and hiring managers. Teams struggle to keep up!\n\nScheduling a final round is an excellent example of our customers' challenges. A recruiter needs to collect availability from the candidate, identify potential interviewers, perform “Calendar Tetris” to find who is available to interview the candidate, schedule on the earliest date possible, and perform any last-minute adjustments as availability changes. They must perform this while considering the interview load on each individual and whether interviewers need to be trained and shadowing others.\n\nAshby provides talent teams with intelligent and powerful software that provides insights into where they’re failing and automates or simplifies many of the tasks they’re underwater with. We put a lot of effort into designing products that are approachable to beginners but mastered and extended by power users. In many ways, spreadsheets set the bar here (and are what we often replace!).\n\n\nWHY YOU SHOULD OR SHOULDN’T APPLY\n\n\nYOUR QUALIFICATIONS:\n\n - 4+ years of product design experience in desktop SaaS.\n\n - Able to think from first principles instead of simply applying the “standard” UX processes.\n\n - Can break down complex user problems by asking questions that narrow down the solution space.\n\n - Enough experience that your intuition can solve many usability problems without having to rely solely on data & metrics or conducting user research.\n\n - Curious & resourceful enough to come up with creative solutions and de-risk them appropriately.\n\n - Strong skills in layout, navigation, IA, UI, and interaction design.\n\n - Strong visual design skills and obsession with craft & details.\n\n - As a bonus, you have experience at an early-stage startup or have spent time as a solo designer on a team.\n\n\nYOU MAY WANT TO APPLY IF YOU’RE EXCITED ABOUT:\n\n - Creating leverage and impact far and above what you'd see in a typical EPD product team structure.

            "descriptionHtml": "<p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Hi 👋🏾, I’m <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/abhikpramanik/\"><u>Abhik</u></a>, Ashby’s Co-Founder and VP of Engineering. We’re looking for a great (former) engineer who built impressive products and now builds teams of great engineers. Ashby’s success and ambition mean we’re doubling the Engineering team in the next year, and we need your experience and leadership to do it thoughtfully.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Our product and growth are exceptional. Ashby All-in-One is powerful, easy to use, and replaces several venture-backed companies' worth of products (often with a <em>better</em> experience). We have notable customers like Notion, Linear, Shopify, and Snowflake. Our growth and retention metrics are best-in-class among our peers: we have tens of millions in ARR, growing &gt;100% year over year, very low churn, and many years of runway.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">A big part of our secret sauce is how we run Engineering. We achieve incredible speed and quality by discarding many industry norms and being optimistic about Engineers. We consider what makes exceptional Engineers exceptional, figure out how to hire them, and build an environment that gives them the freedom and agency to <em>actually</em> be exceptional. In other words, if engineers writing product specs, making product decisions, and <em>not</em> breaking down projects into individual tickets excites you, you’ve found the right place.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">As an Engineering Manager, you’ll work closely with me, Colin, and your peers to build out the team and continue scaling this unique culture.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You’ll first do that through grassroots leadership. You’ll manage three to five Engineers and hire three to five more. They’ll cover multiple teams and a variety of specializations, from Product Engineers to Site Reliability Engineers to Design Engineers. Your day-to-day will include:</p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Providing feedback on product and technical specs to help engineers identify where to cut scope or improve quality. You don’t make the final decisions, but you’ll influence and coach ICs to reach the right ones.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Grow engineers to the point where they can take large, loosely defined projects and deliver them with little intervention.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Jump into our systems and code to debug a customer issue, ship a small bug fix, or improve our developer experience. Engineering leaders at Ashby are great engineers and enjoy keeping their skills up-to-date (while staying off the critical path).</p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You’ll also propose and lead department and company-wide initiatives. Some examples:</p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Rethink how we (and the industry) do pull request reviews by aligning on goals with the team, sampling a set of PRs to understand how effective they are, and writing a proposal to the team about what we could change to speed up reviews while giving reviewers the time and space to give useful feedback.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Design and improve interviews based on candidate and team feedback. We pride ourselves on thoughtful interviews that simulate actually working with us!</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Improve how we generate and simulate data in demo accounts. It’s a project off the critical path, but it helps you keep up-to-date on our codebase while immensely impacting the business, from Engineering to QA to Sales.</p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">I’ll share more details once we meet.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1><strong>What We’re Building</strong></h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">As engineers, we are used to tooling that makes us <strong>better</strong> at what we do. When we started Ashby, we saw the opposite with Talent Acquisition software. Recruiting teams were leveling up how they did their work, but instead of software meeting this new standard, it held them back.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Scheduling a final round is an excellent example. Recruiting teams wanted to schedule candidates faster, track interviewer preparation and quality, and do it with half the headcount. A recruiter needed to manually collect availability from the candidate, identify qualified interviewers, perform “Calendar Tetris” to find who is available to interview the candidate, schedule on the earliest date possible, and make any last-minute adjustments as availability changed. They must do this while considering the interview load on each individual and whether interviewers need to be trained and shadowing others. 🥵 TA software didn’t help.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">As hiring managers, we know TA is a critical function, and as engineers, we know software can do better. So, we built and continue to build Ashby to give TA teams the <em>highest</em> standard of tooling. Software that’s intelligent and powerful. Software that provides insights into where they’re failing and automates or simplifies many of the tasks they’re underwater with. We want other functions and departments to be jealous of what TA teams can do with Ashby, and today they often are!</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1><strong>Why You Shouldn’t Apply</strong></h1><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You don’t enjoy coding or don’t find time to stay up-to-date on technology.</em> We believe great leaders are folks who were great engineers themselves. That starts with loving the craft and never giving it up.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You follow the rules and accept the hand you’ve been dealt.</em> We want folks with the ambition, courage, and follow-through to change things, whether it’s within their own team or across departments.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You went into management because it was the only growth path available.</em> We want folks who could have been Principal engineers (or were one!).</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You're happy with a team of engineers who are predominantly early-career or mid-career or don't thrive with ownership or autonomy.</em> You believe that with enough guardrails, the team can get things done.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>To you, a Staff or Principal Engineer is someone who spends most of their time project managing or conducting architecture reviews.</em> You don’t believe staff and principal engineers could lead by the example they set or the leverage they create through their work.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You’re not optimistic or convinced that we can build a large engineering team that functions differently from the status quo.</em> You think, at some size, common processes need to be implemented to ensure consistent product delivery (e.g., sprint planning, product managers writing in-depth specifications). You might not say it out loud, but you think, at some size, compromises have to be made for the sake of hiring numbers or consistency.</p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1><strong>Engineering Culture</strong></h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Our engineering culture is motivated by Benji’s (my Co-founder and CEO) and my belief that a small, talented team, given the right environment, can build high-quality software fast (and work regular hours!). We do it through:</p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Minimal process with ownership over decisions normally made by product and design</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Natural collaboration and deliberate communication</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Investing in tools and abstractions that give us leverage</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Putting effort into building a diverse team</p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You’ll be an <em>important</em> <em>part</em> of figuring out how to scale these methods from 50 engineers to 100 and beyond.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h2><strong>Minimal Process &amp; Lots of Ownership</strong></h2><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">The best engineers we’ve worked with delivered reliably magical outcomes. They took customer problems and relentlessly drove them to solutions that were not only successful but often brilliant and creative. While they did this with minimal oversight, stakeholders were never in the dark as to what was going on, and no setback was a surprise.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Traditional product-development processes aren’t meant for the best engineers. Their purpose is to create consistent outcomes regardless of the engineer’s skill. But, consistency comes at the expense of an engineer’s time and freedom—both ingredients necessary to generate those magical outcomes. As a result, process stifles the best engineers and doesn’t give others the opportunity to practice the behaviors that made the best engineers the “best.”</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">At Ashby, we want to build an environment that encourages every engineer to be their best. So, at Ashby, every Engineer runs their project. Product Managers (and Designers) build strategy, do customer research, and hand off problem briefs to Engineers. Engineers take on the rest: they research the problem, write product specs, build wireframes, and implement their solution end-to-end. We rely on engineers, not process, to push information outward to the relevant folks (e.g., Product Managers) and pull folks in to help (e.g., Designers, Infra). It’s a new level of ownership for many engineers, but we’d rather an engineer fail a bit and coach up their skills than use process as a crutch. Not everyone succeeds in our culture, but those who do <em>thrive</em>.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h2><strong>Collaboration is Natural &amp; Communication is Deliberate</strong></h2><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Our engineering team consists of lifelong learners who are talented but also humble and kind (meet them <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://www.ashbyhq.com/team\"><u>here</u></a>!). These attributes create an environment where collaboration happens naturally. We combine this with research, prototyping, and written proposals to see around corners and get feedback from the team across time zones. Focus time is something that we hold sacred, and, with thoughtful and deliberate communication, engineers are in &lt;2h meetings per week (I wrote about it <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://www.ashbyhq.com/blog/company/thoughtful-communication\"><u>here</u></a>).</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">To drive it home, here's a recent calendar of an engineer who has been with us for over 4 years:</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><div style=\"text-align:left\"><img style=\"max-width:100%\" src=\"https://app.ashbyhq.com/api/images/user-content/4ea5f68e-c33e-4ac9-831a-e732bee4a303/d4679311-9dba-4031-bf5e-19ce78597ab1/calendar.png\" /></div><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We also meet in person at least twice a year, once as a department and once as a company. You also have a small budget to meet up with folks in your city/region.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h2><strong>Increase Leverage, not Team Size</strong></h2><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We built Ashby with the quality, breadth, and depth that many customers would expect from much larger teams over larger time scales. We’ve done this through investment in:</p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><strong>Great developer tooling.</strong> Our CI/CD takes ~10m, and we deploy at least 15x a day. A debugger that works out of the box. Everyone on the team has contributed to our developer experience 💪🏾.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><strong>Building blocks to create powerful and customizable products fast.</strong> At the core of Ashby is a set of common components (analytics modeling and query language, policy engine, workflow engine, design system) that we constantly improve. Each improvement to a common component cascades throughout our app (short video below).</p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Here’s an impromptu quote from Arjun in our company Slack of what it’s like to build a feature at Ashby:</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><div style=\"text-align:left\"><img style=\"max-width:100%\" src=\"https://app.ashbyhq.com/api/images/user-content/4ea5f68e-c33e-4ac9-831a-e732bee4a303/8d94727a-46d8-42a2-9627-ddcd7f822f95/arjun.png\" /></div><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">And a demo of one of these building blocks:</p><div><div style=\"left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:62.5%\"><iframe src=\"https://embedded-media.ashbyhq.com/embed/4ea5f68e-c33e-4ac9-831a-e732bee4a303/9a5f032d-c731-411e-98cf-261517156f01\" style=\"top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0\" allowfullscreen scrolling=\"no\" allow=\"encrypted-media *; picture-in-picture *;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-presentation\"></iframe></div></div><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h2><strong>Put Effort into Diversity</strong></h2><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Diverse teams drive innovation and better outcomes. Having seen my mother and partner build their careers as minority women in non-diverse fields, I want to make sure Ashby creates opportunities for the next generation of engineers from underrepresented groups.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Today, 21% of engineers at Ashby are from underrepresented groups. It’s not great, and we are taking conscious steps to improve, like sourcing diverse candidates, providing generous paid family leave, no leetcode interviews, and more.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1><strong>Interview Process</strong></h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">This is an important role and our interview process reflects that both in challenge and length (5h 15m):</p><ol style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Introduction call with me (30m, live)</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">A technical screen where we pair in our actual codebase (1h, live)</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">An interview to explore your past experience as a leader (1h, live)</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Interview with Colin, our Head of EMEA Engineering (45m, live)</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Interview with Benji, our CEO (30m, live)</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Final round where you meet Engineers and other Engineering Managers (90m, live)</p></li></ol><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Depending on my bandwidth, we may start with an <em>additional</em> 30m screen with a recruiter. Near the end of the process, we’ll do reference checks.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">This is also an important decision for you, so I’m always happy to have coffee chats in person or over Zoom to get to know each other. If we don’t move forward, we’re happy to share feedback.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1><strong>Your First Six Months at Ashby</strong></h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Your first three months at Ashby will be spent learning about Ashby Engineering and easing into leadership. While most of your onboarding will be driven by a 6-month plan you put together (and refine over time), you’ll also ship some product changes and features. What better way to learn how ICs work than to be one! Don’t worry if you don’t know our technologies. The team is really helpful and our dev environment is pretty awesome: it sets up in a single script and you’ll be able to push your first product change on day one.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You and I will do 30-day, 60-day, 90-day, and 6-month reviews to calibrate on our unique culture and how you, I, and the team will work together.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1><strong>Benefits</strong></h1><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Competitive salary and equity.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">10-year exercise window for stock options. You shouldn’t feel pressure to purchase stock options if you leave Ashby —do it when you feel financially comfortable.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Unlimited PTO.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">A minimum of 12 weeks of fully paid parental leave, covered by Ashby. For folks outside the US, it may be longer to be in line with regional requirements.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Generous equipment, software, and office furniture budget. Get what you need to be happy and productive!</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">$100/month education budget with more expensive items (like conferences) covered with manager approval.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">If you’re in the US, we offer top-tier health insurance for you and your dependents, with 100% of premiums covered by Ashby. In other countries, we provide high-quality supplemental health insurance for you and your dependents, also fully covered by us.</p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Ashby’s success hinges on hiring great people and creating an environment where we can be happy, feel challenged, and do our best work. We’re being deliberate about building that environment from the ground up. I hope that excites you enough to apply.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>Ashby provides equal employment opportunities (EEO) to all employees and applicants for employment without regard to race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability, genetics, sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression.

We’ve done this through investment in:\n\n - Great developer tooling. Our CI/CD takes ~10m, and we deploy at least 15x a day. A debugger that works out of the box. Everyone on the team has contributed to our developer experience 💪🏾.\n\n - Building blocks to create powerful and customizable products fast. At the core of Ashby is a set of common components (analytics modeling and query language, policy engine, workflow engine, design system) that we constantly improve. Each improvement to a common component cascades throughout our app (short video below).\n\nHere’s an impromptu quote from Arjun in our company Slack of what it’s like to build a feature at Ashby:\n\n[https://app.ashbyhq.com/api/images/user-content/4ea5f68e-c33e-4ac9-831a-e732bee4a303/8d94727a-46d8-42a2-9627-ddcd7f822f95/arjun.png]\n\nAnd a demo of one of these building blocks:\n\n\nPUT EFFORT INTO DIVERSITY\n\nDiverse teams drive innovation and better outcomes. Having seen my mother and partner build their careers as minority women in non-diverse fields, I want to make sure Ashby creates opportunities for the next generation of engineers from underrepresented groups.\n\nToday, 21% of engineers at Ashby are from underrepresented groups. It’s not great, and we are taking conscious steps to improve, like sourcing diverse candidates, providing generous paid family leave, no leetcode interviews, and more.\n\n\nINTERVIEW PROCESS\n\nThis is an important role and our interview process reflects that both in challenge and length (5h 15m):\n\n 1. Introduction call with me (30m, live)\n\n 2. A technical screen where we pair in our actual codebase (1h, live)\n\n 3. An interview to explore your past experience as a leader (1h, live)\n\n 4. Interview with Colin, our Head of EMEA Engineering (45m, live)\n\n 5. Interview with Benji, our CEO (30m, live)\n\n 6. Final round where you meet Engineers and other Engineering Managers (90m, live)\n\nDepending on my bandwidth, we may start with an additional 30m screen with a recruiter. Near the end of the process, we’ll do reference checks.\n\nThis is also an important decision for you, so I’m always happy to have coffee chats in person or over Zoom to get to know each other. If we don’t move forward, we’re happy to share feedback.\n\n\nYOUR FIRST SIX MONTHS AT ASHBY\n\nYour first three months at Ashby will be spent learning about Ashby Engineering and easing into leadership. While most of your onboarding will be driven by a 6-month plan you put together (and refine over time), you’ll also ship some product changes and features. What better way to learn how ICs work than to be one! Don’t worry if you don’t know our technologies. The team is really helpful and our dev environment is pretty awesome: it sets up in a single script and you’ll be able to push your first product change on day one.\n\nYou and I will do 30-day, 60-day, 90-day, and 6-month reviews to calibrate on our unique culture and how you, I, and the team will work together.\n\n\nBENEFITS\n\n - Competitive salary and equity.\n\n - 10-year exercise window for stock options. You shouldn’t feel pressure to purchase stock options if you leave Ashby —do it when you feel financially comfortable.\n\n - Unlimited PTO.\n\n - A minimum of 12 weeks of fully paid parental leave, covered by Ashby. For folks outside the US, it may be longer to be in line with regional requirements.\n\n - Generous equipment, software, and office furniture budget. Get what you need to be happy and productive!\n\n - $100/month education budget with more expensive items (like conferences) covered with manager approval.\n\n - If you’re in the US, we offer top-tier health insurance for you and your dependents, with 100% of premiums covered by Ashby. In other countries, we provide high-quality supplemental health insurance for you and your dependents, also fully covered by us.\n\nAshby’s success hinges on hiring great people and creating an environment where we can be happy, feel challenged, and do our best work. We’re being deliberate about building that environment from the ground up. I hope that excites you enough to apply.\n\nAshby provides equal employment opportunities (EEO) to all employees and applicants for employment without regard to race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability, genetics, sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression.

            "descriptionHtml": "<p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Hi 👋🏾 I’m <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/abhikpramanik/\"><u>Abhik</u></a>, Ashby's Co-Founder and VP of Engineering. As someone who could design and build software, this position is close to my heart. I always felt I had a unique perspective because I could play with design ideas and iterate <em>in code</em>. My ideas could start in Figma but then be grounded (or sometimes more creative) in code. My prototypes used actual logic and data. My changes cascaded throughout the app for comprehensive critique (thanks, React component system!). But, every company made me pick one —I couldn’t design <em>and </em>build. At Ashby, you can.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">While every engineer can design <em>and </em>build, you’ll tackle our most challenging design problems and help others improve their designs by expanding and enhancing our in-house design system and consulting on bespoke work. To ground it with examples, engineers who can design at Ashby have:</p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Redesigned our mobile web app by talking with customers who use it often, wireframing new flows, implementing its design system, and using it to make the wireframes a reality.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Built a set of flexible, composable components in our design system that allow other engineers to build custom autocompletes. These autocompletes can contain filters, options to create new records, etc.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Helped another engineer improve their design's information hierarchy and scannability for viewing a candidate’s assessments. Recruiters can quickly parse information and pick out anomalies.</p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">These projects reflect what we’re accomplishing at Ashby: improving the productivity of working professionals (starting with talent teams) with intelligent and powerful software. We put a lot of effort into designing products that are approachable to beginners but mastered &amp; extended by power users. In many ways, spreadsheets set the bar here.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We have notable customers like Notion, Linear, Shopify, and Snowflake. Our growth and retention metrics are best-in-class among our peers: we have tens of millions in ARR, growing &gt;100% year over year, over 2500 customers, very low churn, and many years of runway. We’ll share more details once we meet, but you now probably have a good idea as to why we're hiring for this role 😅.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1>What We’re Building</h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">As engineers, we are used to tooling that makes us <strong>better</strong> at what we do. When we started Ashby, we saw the opposite with Talent Acquisition software. Recruiting teams were leveling up how they did their work, but instead of software meeting this new standard, it held them back.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Scheduling a final round is an excellent example. Recruiting teams wanted to schedule candidates faster, track interviewer preparation and quality, and do it with half the headcount. A recruiter needed to manually collect availability from the candidate, identify qualified interviewers, perform “Calendar Tetris” to find who is available to interview the candidate, schedule on the earliest date possible, and make any last-minute adjustments as availability changed. They must do this while considering the interview load on each individual and whether interviewers need to be trained and shadowing others. 🥵 TA software didn’t help.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">As hiring managers, we know TA is a critical function, and as engineers, we know software can do better. So, we built and continue to build Ashby to give TA teams the <em>highest</em> standard of tooling. Software that’s intelligent and powerful. Software that provides insights into where they’re failing and automates or simplifies many of the tasks they’re underwater with. We want other functions and departments to be jealous of what TA teams can do with Ashby, and today they often are!</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1>Engineering Culture</h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Our engineering culture is motivated by Benji’s (my Co-founder and CEO) and my belief that a small, talented team, given the right environment, can build high-quality software fast (and work regular hours!). We do it through:</p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Minimal process with ownership over decisions normally made by product and design</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Natural collaboration and deliberate communication</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Investing in tools and abstractions that give us leverage</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Putting effort into building a diverse team</p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h2><strong>Minimal Process &amp; Lots of Ownership</strong></h2><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">The best engineers we’ve worked with delivered reliably magical outcomes. They took customer problems and relentlessly drove them to solutions that were not only successful but often brilliant and creative. While they did this with minimal oversight, stakeholders were never in the dark as to what was going on, and no setback was a surprise.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Traditional product-development processes aren’t meant for the best engineers. Their purpose is to create consistent outcomes regardless of the engineer’s skill. But, consistency comes at the expense of an engineer’s time and freedom—both ingredients necessary to generate those magical outcomes. As a result, process stifles the best engineers and doesn’t give others the opportunity to practice the behaviors that made the best engineers the “best.”</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">At Ashby, we want to build an environment that encourages every engineer to be their best. So, at Ashby, every Engineer runs their project. Product Managers (and Designers) build strategy, do customer research, and hand off problem briefs to Engineers. Engineers take on the rest: they research the problem, write product specs, build wireframes, and implement their solution end-to-end. We rely on engineers, not process, to push information outward to the relevant folks (e.g., Product Managers) and pull folks in to help (e.g., Designers, Infra). It’s a new level of ownership for many engineers, but we’d rather an engineer fail a bit and coach up their skills than use process as a crutch. Not everyone succeeds in our culture, but those who do <em>thrive</em>.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h2><strong>Collaboration is Natural &amp; Communication is Deliberate</strong></h2><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Our engineering team consists of lifelong learners who are talented but also humble and kind (meet them <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://www.ashbyhq.com/team\"><u>here</u></a>!). These attributes create an environment where collaboration happens naturally. We combine this with research, prototyping, and written proposals to see around corners and get feedback from the team across time zones. Focus time is something that we hold sacred, and, with thoughtful and deliberate communication, engineers are in &lt;2h meetings per week (I wrote about it <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://www.ashbyhq.com/blog/company/thoughtful-communication\"><u>here</u></a>).</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">To drive it home, here's a recent calendar of an engineer who has been with us for over 4 years:</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><div style=\"text-align:left\"><img style=\"max-width:100%\" src=\"https://app.ashbyhq.com/api/images/user-content/4ea5f68e-c33e-4ac9-831a-e732bee4a303/d4679311-9dba-4031-bf5e-19ce78597ab1/calendar.png\" /></div><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We also meet in person at least twice a year, once as a department and once as a company. You also have a small budget to meet up with folks in your city/region.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h2><strong>Increase Leverage, not Team Size</strong></h2><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We built Ashby with the quality, breadth, and depth that many customers would expect from much larger teams over larger time scales.

            "descriptionPlain": "Hi 👋🏾 I’m Abhik https://www.linkedin.com/in/abhikpramanik/, Ashby's Co-Founder and VP of Engineering. As someone who could design and build software, this position is close to my heart. I always felt I had a unique perspective because I could play with design ideas and iterate in code. My ideas could start in Figma but then be grounded (or sometimes more creative) in code. My prototypes used actual logic and data. My changes cascaded throughout the app for comprehensive critique (thanks, React component system!). But, every company made me pick one —I couldn’t design and build. At Ashby, you can.\n\nWhile every engineer can design and build, you’ll tackle our most challenging design problems and help others improve their designs by expanding and enhancing our in-house design system and consulting on bespoke work. To ground it with examples, engineers who can design at Ashby have:\n\n - Redesigned our mobile web app by talking with customers who use it often, wireframing new flows, implementing its design system, and using it to make the wireframes a reality.\n\n - Built a set of flexible, composable components in our design system that allow other engineers to build custom autocompletes. These autocompletes can contain filters, options to create new records, etc.\n\n - Helped another engineer improve their design's information hierarchy and scannability for viewing a candidate’s assessments. Recruiters can quickly parse information and pick out anomalies.\n\nThese projects reflect what we’re accomplishing at Ashby: improving the productivity of working professionals (starting with talent teams) with intelligent and powerful software. We put a lot of effort into designing products that are approachable to beginners but mastered & extended by power users. In many ways, spreadsheets set the bar here.\n\nWe have notable customers like Notion, Linear, Shopify, and Snowflake. Our growth and retention metrics are best-in-class among our peers: we have tens of millions in ARR, growing >100% year over year, over 2500 customers, very low churn, and many years of runway. We’ll share more details once we meet, but you now probably have a good idea as to why we're hiring for this role 😅.\n\n\nWHAT WE’RE BUILDING\n\nAs engineers, we are used to tooling that makes us better at what we do. When we started Ashby, we saw the opposite with Talent Acquisition software. Recruiting teams were leveling up how they did their work, but instead of software meeting this new standard, it held them back.\n\nScheduling a final round is an excellent example. Recruiting teams wanted to schedule candidates faster, track interviewer preparation and quality, and do it with half the headcount. A recruiter needed to manually collect availability from the candidate, identify qualified interviewers, perform “Calendar Tetris” to find who is available to interview the candidate, schedule on the earliest date possible, and make any last-minute adjustments as availability changed. They must do this while considering the interview load on each individual and whether interviewers need to be trained and shadowing others. 🥵 TA software didn’t help.\n\nAs hiring managers, we know TA is a critical function, and as engineers, we know software can do better. So, we built and continue to build Ashby to give TA teams the highest standard of tooling. Software that’s intelligent and powerful. Software that provides insights into where they’re failing and automates or simplifies many of the tasks they’re underwater with. We want other functions and departments to be jealous of what TA teams can do with Ashby, and today they often are!\n\n\nENGINEERING CULTURE\n\nOur engineering culture is motivated by Benji’s (my Co-founder and CEO) and my belief that a small, talented team, given the right environment, can build high-quality software fast (and work regular hours!). We do it through:\n\n - Minimal process with ownership over decisions normally made by product and design\n\n - Natural collaboration and deliberate communication\n\n - Investing in tools and abstractions that give us leverage\n\n - Putting effort into building a diverse team\n\n\nMINIMAL PROCESS & LOTS OF OWNERSHIP\n\nThe best engineers we’ve worked with delivered reliably magical outcomes. They took customer problems and relentlessly drove them to solutions that were not only successful but often brilliant and creative. While they did this with minimal oversight, stakeholders were never in the dark as to what was going on, and no setback was a surprise.\n\nTraditional product-development processes aren’t meant for the best engineers. Their purpose is to create consistent outcomes regardless of the engineer’s skill. But, consistency comes at the expense of an engineer’s time and freedom—both ingredients necessary to generate those magical outcomes. As a result, process stifles the best engineers and doesn’t give others the opportunity to practice the behaviors that made the best engineers the “best.”\n\nAt Ashby, we want to build an environment that encourages every engineer to be their best. So, at Ashby, every Engineer runs their project. Product Managers (and Designers) build strategy, do customer research, and hand off problem briefs to Engineers. Engineers take on the rest: they research the problem, write product specs, build wireframes, and implement their solution end-to-end. We rely on engineers, not process, to push information outward to the relevant folks (e.g., Product Managers) and pull folks in to help (e.g., Designers, Infra). It’s a new level of ownership for many engineers, but we’d rather an engineer fail a bit and coach up their skills than use process as a crutch. Not everyone succeeds in our culture, but those who do thrive.\n\n\nCOLLABORATION IS NATURAL & COMMUNICATION IS DELIBERATE\n\nOur engineering team consists of lifelong learners who are talented but also humble and kind (meet them here https://www.ashbyhq.com/team!). These attributes create an environment where collaboration happens naturally. We combine this with research, prototyping, and written proposals to see around corners and get feedback from the team across time zones. Focus time is something that we hold sacred, and, with thoughtful and deliberate communication, engineers are in <2h meetings per week (I wrote about it here https://www.ashbyhq.com/blog/company/thoughtful-communication).\n\nTo drive it home, here's a recent calendar of an engineer who has been with us for over 4 years:\n\n[https://app.ashbyhq.com/api/images/user-content/4ea5f68e-c33e-4ac9-831a-e732bee4a303/d4679311-9dba-4031-bf5e-19ce78597ab1/calendar.png]\n\nWe also meet in person at least twice a year, once as a department and once as a company. You also have a small budget to meet up with folks in your city/region.\n\n\nINCREASE LEVERAGE, NOT TEAM SIZE\n\nWe built Ashby with the quality, breadth, and depth that many customers would expect from much larger teams over larger time scales. We’ve done this through investment in:\n\n - Great developer tooling. Our CI/CD takes ~10m, and we deploy at least 15x a day. A debugger that works out of the box. Everyone on the team has contributed to our developer experience 💪🏾.\n\n - Building blocks to create powerful and customizable products fast. At the core of Ashby is a set of common components (analytics modeling and query language, policy engine, workflow engine, design system) that we constantly improve. Each improvement to a common component cascades throughout our app (short video below).\n\nHere’s an impromptu quote from Arjun in our company Slack of what it’s like to build a feature at Ashby:\n\n[https://app.ashbyhq.com/api/images/user-content/4ea5f68e-c33e-4ac9-831a-e732bee4a303/8d94727a-46d8-42a2-9627-ddcd7f822f95/arjun.png]\n\nAnd a demo of one of these building blocks:\n\n\nPUT EFFORT INTO DIVERSITY\n\nDiverse teams drive innovation and better outcomes. Having seen my mother and partner build their careers as minority women in non-diverse fields, I want to make sure Ashby creates opportunities for the next generation of engineers from underrepresented groups.\n\nToday, 21% of engineers at Ashby are from underrepresented groups. It’s not great, and we are taking conscious steps to improve, like sourcing diverse candidates, providing generous paid family leave, no leetcode interviews, and more.\n\n\nINTERVIEW PROCESS\n\nAt Ashby, our team and interview process want to help you show your best self. We’ll dive into past projects and simulate working together via pair programming, writing product and tech specs collaboratively, and talking through decisions. There are no leetcode or whiteboard exercises.\n\nOur interview process is three rounds:\n\n 1. Introduction call with Hiring Manager (15 to 30m, live)\n\n 2. A technical screen where we pair in our actual codebase (1h, live)\n\n 3. Three non-coding interviews that focus on product thinking, technical design, and infrastructure (3h 15m, live can be split across multiple days)\n\nDepending on our leadership team’s bandwidth, we may start with an additional 30m screen with a recruiter.\n\nYour hiring manager will be your main point of contact and prep you for interviews. Each round will have written guidance so you know what to expect (you’ll need minimal preparation). You’ll meet 4 to 6 people in engineering (with 5-15 minutes in each interview to ask them questions). If we don’t give an offer, we’ll provide feedback!\n\n\nYOUR FIRST THREE MONTHS AT ASHBY\n\nWe want an exceptional onboarding experience for every new hire. At Ashby, your dev environment is set up with a single script, you push your first product change on day one, and you spend the rest of your time shipping product changes that give you a tour of our codebase and best practices.

The rest of the team will run training sessions on our culture, product, engineering process, and technical architecture.\n\n\nTECHNOLOGY STACK\n\nI’m sharing our tech stack with the caveat that we don’t require previous experience in it (but a love of typed languages is helpful 😀): TypeScript (frontend & backend), React, GraphQL API, Node.js, Postgres, Redis.\n\nWhen they joined Ashby, many of our engineers switched from other languages like Swift and Kotlin (Ben https://linkedin.com/in/benasher44/), platforms like iOS (Tom https://www.linkedin.com/in/tom-quist-0925a199/) and Windows (Sergey https://www.linkedin.com/in/sergeygalich/). We care more about fundamentals (e.g., debugging, abstractions) and how fast you learn. For folks on the team who switched, it's nice seeing changes hot reload versus waiting for XCode to compile 😅.\n\n\nBENEFITS\n\n - Competitive salary and equity.\n\n - 10-year exercise window for stock options. You shouldn’t feel pressure to purchase stock options if you leave Ashby —do it when you feel financially comfortable.\n\n - Unlimited PTO, and we will encourage you to take it.\n\n - A minimum of 12 weeks of fully paid parental leave, covered by Ashby. For folks outside the US, it may be longer to be in line with regional requirements.\n\n - Generous equipment, software, and office furniture budget.

At Ashby, you'll be part designer, part product manager, part consultant, and part design system manager (or some combination of the 4!). We do design differently here, and if that excites you, read on.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Our unique approach is working - we're growing &gt;100% year-over-year and have notable customers like Notion, Linear, Shopify, and Snowflake. Our growth and retention metrics are best-in-class among our peers: we have tens of millions in ARR, very low churn, and many years of runway. We're backed by amazing investors like Y Combinator, Elad Gil, Lachy Groom, and many more! We’ll share more details once we meet.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1>How We Work</h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">In my previous roles, product teams always consisted of a product manager, a designer, and ~4-5 engineers. This may sound familiar to you! The product manager briefs the designer who then designs. After designing, mocks are handed to the engineers. <br /><br />We take a more principled approach here at Ashby. If you've been designing software enough, you'll realize in actuality, design is required in varying degrees on each project. Sometimes in the past, I'd be asked to design yet another settings page, when really all that was needed was an engineer to reuse existing components and just follow some documentation I had written. Other times, I felt I should effectively be the product manager and own a project from beginning to end. In these latter cases, it made sense that I was even the one providing project updates and managing resources rather than constantly being pinged by a separate product manager.<br /><br />This principled approach is now what we do here, and it is part of what has allowed Ashby to take down incumbents in multiple verticals all at once. We don't settle for the status quo—we actively resist reversion to the mean.<br /><br />Currently, I report to Benji, the co-founder &amp; CEO. Both Abhik and Benji (our founders) care deeply about design, which at first glance may seem counterintuitive given the number of full-time designers that we employ. The belief is not that design is unimportant, but rather that it should be owned by the product team collectively, not solely by a group of full-time designers who happen to have the job title. <br /><br />The design <em><strong>department’s</strong></em> job at Ashby is not to make every single design decision but to equip our entire product team to make better decisions themselves, as well as edit decisions that PMs/Engineers choose to make. That, while tackling the biggest design challenges ourselves. </p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Separate from design, you may also be excited by the fact that we maintain a near seed-stage-like culture with fuzzy lines between functional roles, as much autonomy as you can handle, and a focus on IC-work with an almost-no-meeting culture. While you get the product-market fit and scale of a growth-stage startup, you also get the agency and no-nonsense, no-red-tape culture of a seed-stage startup.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1>What We’re Building</h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Talent teams aspire to build a hiring process that identifies great candidates, moves them quickly through the interview process, and provides an excellent experience for the candidate. To accomplish this, recruiters perform thousands of daily tasks to coordinate and relay information between candidates, interviewers, and hiring managers. Teams struggle to keep up!</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Scheduling a final round is an excellent example of our customers' challenges. A recruiter needs to collect availability from the candidate, identify potential interviewers, perform “Calendar Tetris” to find who is available to interview the candidate, schedule on the earliest date possible, and perform any last-minute adjustments as availability changes. They must perform this while considering the interview load on each individual and whether interviewers need to be trained and shadowing others. </p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Ashby provides talent teams with intelligent and powerful software that provides insights into where they’re failing and automates or simplifies many of the tasks they’re underwater with. We put a lot of effort into designing products that are approachable to beginners but mastered and extended by power users. In many ways, spreadsheets set the bar here (and are what we often replace!).</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1>Why you should or shouldn’t apply</h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h2>Your qualifications:</h2><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">10+ years of product design experience, with the majority being in desktop SaaS</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Able to take huge, ambiguous projects and break them down into actionable parts </p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Able to speak to patterns of the highest functioning design teams and how to create an environment of high performance</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Able to leverage designers' superpowers to influence engineering, product, and the rest of the company</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Able to create standards and principles that will help improve the quality of design across the product org</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Able to think from first principles instead of simply applying the “standard” UX processes.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Enough experience that your intuition can solve most usability problems without having to rely solely on data &amp; metrics or conducting user research.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Curious &amp; resourceful enough to come up with creative solutions and de-risk them appropriately.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Best-in-class skills in layout, navigation, IA, UI, and interaction design.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Obsession with craft &amp; details.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You have experience<em> </em>at an early-stage startup or have spent time as a solo designer on a team.</p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h2>You may want to apply if you’re excited about:</h2><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Creating leverage and impact far and above what you'd see in a typical EPD product team structure.

We’re looking for an ambitious full-stack engineer who is laser-focused on solving customer problems and making the right long-term investments to solve them not only today but in our future features and products.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">What Ashby gives you in return is the best of both early and growth-stage environments. The agency and no-nonsense of a seed startup: you write product specs, make product and design decisions, and build in an almost-no-meeting culture. While also the product-market fit and scale of a growth-stage startup: tens of thousands of daily users who depend on your software and eagerly await your next feature.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We have notable customers like Notion, Linear, Shopify, and Snowflake. Our growth and retention metrics are best-in-class among our peers: we have tens of millions in ARR, growing &gt;100% year over year, very low churn, and many years of runway. We’ll share more details once we meet.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You’ve probably seen this role posted before, and it’s because we’re always expanding the team (we’re on track to double this year). We’re bubbling with ideas on how to support Talent Acquisition through software, and we’ve started the journey of building products beyond Talent Acquisition. We read every application and aim to respond to yours within 3-4 days (often sooner).</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1>About the Role and How We Work</h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Our engineering culture strives to recreate the environments where we did our best work as ICs – where we had the ownership and agency to impact our users with creative and innovative software.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">I started my career building software for artists in the Visual Effects industry. It was a formative experience for me as a software engineer because success relied on my ability to be a product manager and designer. I talked to artists to understand their needs. I came up with ideas. I did industry research, designed interfaces, and prototyped ideas. I watched artists use what I built and decided what to tackle in the next iteration. No daily stand-ups, no t-shirt sizing, no planning meetings.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">I studied computer science to solve problems, not tickets, and this felt exactly like that. I not only felt creative and fulfilled but the agency and ownership we were given as engineers powered an incredible amount of innovation.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Innovation came differently (or not at all) at technology startups beyond the seed stage, often through an engineer’s force of will and ability to push back against culture (rather than any encouragement from it). Engineering was narrowed to implementation and delivery, partly due to the influence of other departments and partly due to the influx of \"Agile\" processes like sprint planning. In those companies, I felt like a JIRA jockey. </p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">At Ashby, we’re building an environment that is optimistic about what engineers can own and achieve. An environment that embraces innovative engineers, and, frankly, often stays out of their way. As a Product Engineer, you’ll take ownership over a large portion of one of our products and own projects end-to-end (wearing hats traditionally worn by product and design). You’ll research competitors, write product specs, make wireframes, and more. To ground it with examples, product engineers at Ashby have:</p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Designed and built automated interview scheduling. This feature automates scheduling by calculating possible times from a pool of interviewers and other constraints, and then presenting these times to the candidate for selection via our responsive web app. This solves the “Calendar Tetris” problem I talk about in \"What We're Building.\"</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Built a generalized declarative filter architecture that allows users to create complex filters for any record with a consistent UI and compile it to SQL in our backend. Many user-facing features use it.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Specced, designed, and implemented a feature that allows users to complete signing offers entirely within Ashby. This project involved talking to customers to understand their requirements, deciding what technologies to use, building a prototype, and working with other team members to integrate the final implementation into additional features.</p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1>What We’re Building</h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">As engineers, we are used to tooling that makes us <strong>better</strong> at what we do. When we started Ashby, we saw the opposite with Talent Acquisition software. Recruiting teams were leveling up how they did their work, but instead of software meeting this new standard, it held them back.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Scheduling a final round is an excellent example. Recruiting teams wanted to schedule candidates faster, track interviewer preparation and quality, and do it with half the headcount. A recruiter needed to manually collect availability from the candidate, identify qualified interviewers, perform “Calendar Tetris” to find who is available to interview the candidate, schedule on the earliest date possible, and make any last-minute adjustments as availability changed. They must do this while considering the interview load on each individual and whether interviewers need to be trained and shadowing others. 🥵 TA software didn’t help.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">As hiring managers, we know TA is a critical function, and as engineers, we know software can do better. So, we built and continue to build Ashby to give TA teams the <em>highest</em> standard of tooling. Software that’s intelligent and powerful. Software that provides insights into where they’re failing and automates or simplifies many of the tasks they’re underwater with. We want other functions and departments to be jealous of what TA teams can do with Ashby, and today they often are!</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1>Why You Should or Shouldn’t Apply</h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Software engineers come in many flavors, not all of which fit our model. Here are some things  to help you decide if this fits you and what you’re looking for:</p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You’re not afraid to tackle any part of a technology stack.</em> You do what’s necessary to successfully deliver a feature, whether writing frontend or choosing new infrastructure. We’ll provide a supportive environment to do it successfully (e.g., design system, SRE team).</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You’ve tackled projects with a lot of product and technical ambiguity, and you thrive at the intersection of the two. </em>We’re not building a simple CRUD app, and many of the challenges we tackle require you to use your knowledge of our customers to build powerful abstractions and flexibility in the system to solve a class of problems.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You know how to strike the right balance between speed and quality. </em>Ashby wasn’t built quickly. We took four years to launch publicly because convincing customers to switch required a high-quality product. However, time isn’t infinite, especially for a startup, so we still move with urgency—we’ve built the equivalent of three or more VC-backed startups with a very small team.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You are ambitious and always looking to improve your skills. </em>For most engineers, this role will give you more freedom and responsibilities than you’ve experienced in the past. To thrive (and level up), you’ll need to be open to feedback (and we give lots of it).</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You’re an excellent collaborator and communicator. </em>Ownership and freedom don’t mean you work in a vacuum. You’ll need to vet your decisions with the appropriate stakeholders, keep them up to date when necessary, and work with other engineers to get your projects across the finish line. Clear and concise communication helps a lot here!</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You seek to create leverage in your work. </em>The nature of software is that you can often automate or abstract what would be tedious, time-consuming work. Your impatience usually leads to new abstractions, tools to allow Support to debug before Engineering, new lint rules to prevent common bugs, etc. </p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><strong>Put another way, you shouldn’t apply if:</strong></p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You need company-driven process and structure to get your projects across the finish line. </em>Sprint planning and well-defined project management processes are things you need or look to others to lead. You’d rather focus on the technical details and challenges.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You only want to do exciting work. </em>We’re building a team of kind, collaborative folks. Customer issues and investigations are distributed across the team, including our high-level ICs.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You can get lost in the details.</em> Once you start implementation, it can be hard to take a step back and think about the project as a whole. You like everything to be planned upfront.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You haven’t led or taken ownership of projects before.</em> You’re used to working with tech leads and taking on tasks distributed by them.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You want to mentor earlier-career engineers.</em> We rely on engineers owning their projects, so we need engineers with that experience. This requires the team to be reasonably tenured. More than 90% of the team would be considered Senior or above in the industry today, so mentorship opportunities are very limited.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>To you, a tech lead, staff, or principal engineer is someone who spends most of their time project managing or doing architecture reviews. </em>Our most tenured engineers spend most of their time building, and we often trust them with our most challenging problems. While they lead product and technical areas and help other engineers plan their most challenging work, it’s not a requirement, nor do engineers need their sign-off.</p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1>Engineering Culture</h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Our engineering culture is motivated by Benji’s (my Co-founder and CEO) and my belief that a small, talented team, given the right environment, can build high-quality software fast (and work regular hours!). We do it through:</p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Minimal process with ownership over decisions normally made by product and design</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Natural collaboration and deliberate communication</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Investing in tools and abstractions that give us leverage</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Putting effort into building a diverse team</p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h2><strong>Minimal Process &amp; Lots of Ownership</strong></h2><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">The best engineers we’ve worked with delivered reliably magical outcomes. They took customer problems and relentlessly drove them to solutions that were not only successful but often brilliant and creative. While they did this with minimal oversight, stakeholders were never in the dark as to what was going on, and no setback was a surprise.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Traditional product-development processes aren’t meant for the best engineers. Their purpose is to create consistent outcomes regardless of the engineer’s skill. But, consistency comes at the expense of an engineer’s time and freedom—both ingredients necessary to generate those magical outcomes. As a result, process stifles the best engineers and doesn’t give others the opportunity to practice the behaviors that made the best engineers the “best.”</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">At Ashby, we want to build an environment that encourages every engineer to be their best. So, at Ashby, every Engineer runs their project. Product Managers (and Designers) build strategy, do customer research, and hand off problem briefs to Engineers. Engineers take on the rest: they research the problem, write product specs, build wireframes, and implement their solution end-to-end. We rely on engineers, not process, to push information outward to the relevant folks (e.g., Product Managers) and pull folks in to help (e.g., Designers, Infra). It’s a new level of ownership for many engineers, but we’d rather an engineer fail a bit and coach up their skills than use process as a crutch. Not everyone succeeds in our culture, but those who do <em>thrive</em>.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h2><strong>Collaboration is Natural &amp; Communication is Deliberate</strong></h2><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Our engineering team consists of lifelong learners who are talented but also humble and kind (meet them <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://www.ashbyhq.com/team\"><u>here</u></a>!). These attributes create an environment where collaboration happens naturally. We combine this with research, prototyping, and written proposals to see around corners and get feedback from the team across time zones. Focus time is something that we hold sacred, and, with thoughtful and deliberate communication, engineers are in &lt;2h meetings per week (I wrote about it <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://www.ashbyhq.com/blog/company/thoughtful-communication\"><u>here</u></a>).</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">To drive it home, here's a recent calendar of an engineer who has been with us for over 4 years:</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><div style=\"text-align:left\"><img style=\"max-width:100%\" src=\"https://app.ashbyhq.com/api/images/user-content/4ea5f68e-c33e-4ac9-831a-e732bee4a303/d4679311-9dba-4031-bf5e-19ce78597ab1/calendar.png\" /></div><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We also meet in person at least twice a year, once as a department and once as a company. You also have a small budget to meet up with folks in your city/region.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h2><strong>Increase Leverage, not Team Size</strong></h2><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We built Ashby with the quality, breadth, and depth that many customers would expect from much larger teams over larger time scales. We’ve done this through investment in:</p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><strong>Great developer tooling.</strong> Our CI/CD takes ~10m, and we deploy at least 15x a day. A debugger that works out of the box. Everyone on the team has contributed to our developer experience 💪🏾.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><strong>Building blocks to create powerful and customizable products fast.</strong> At the core of Ashby is a set of common components (analytics modeling and query language, policy engine, workflow engine, design system) that we constantly improve. Each improvement to a common component cascades throughout our app (short video below).</p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Here’s an impromptu quote from Arjun in our company Slack of what it’s like to build a feature at Ashby:</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><div style=\"text-align:left\"><img style=\"max-width:100%\" src=\"https://app.ashbyhq.com/api/images/user-content/4ea5f68e-c33e-4ac9-831a-e732bee4a303/8d94727a-46d8-42a2-9627-ddcd7f822f95/arjun.png\" /></div><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">And a demo of one of these building blocks:</p><div><div style=\"left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:62.5%\"><iframe src=\"https://embedded-media.ashbyhq.com/embed/4ea5f68e-c33e-4ac9-831a-e732bee4a303/9a5f032d-c731-411e-98cf-261517156f01\" style=\"top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0\" allowfullscreen scrolling=\"no\" allow=\"encrypted-media *; picture-in-picture *;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-presentation\"></iframe></div></div><h2><strong>Put Effort into Diversity</strong></h2><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Diverse teams drive innovation and better outcomes. Having seen my mother and partner build their careers as minority women in non-diverse fields, I want to make sure Ashby creates opportunities for the next generation of engineers from underrepresented groups.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Today, 21% of engineers at Ashby are from underrepresented groups. It’s not great, and we are taking conscious steps to improve, like sourcing diverse candidates, providing generous paid family leave, no leetcode interviews, and more.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1><strong>Interview Process</strong></h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">At Ashby, our team and interview process want to help you show your best self. We’ll dive into past projects and simulate working together via pair programming, writing product and tech specs collaboratively, and talking through decisions. There are no leetcode or whiteboard exercises.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Our interview process is three rounds:</p><ol style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Introduction call with Hiring Manager (15 to 30m, live)</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">A technical screen where we pair in our actual codebase (1h, live)</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Three non-coding interviews that focus on product thinking, technical design, and infrastructure (3h 15m, live can be split across multiple days)</p></li></ol><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Depending on our leadership team’s bandwidth, we may start with an <em>additional</em> 30m screen with a recruiter.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Your hiring manager will be your main point of contact and prep you for interviews. Each round will have written guidance so you know what to expect (you’ll need minimal preparation). You’ll meet 4 to 6 people in engineering (with 5-15 minutes in each interview to ask them questions). If we don’t give an offer, we’ll provide feedback!</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1><strong>Your First Three Months at Ashby</strong></h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We want an exceptional onboarding experience for every new hire. At Ashby, your dev environment is set up with a single script, you push your first product change on day one, and you spend the rest of your time shipping product changes that give you a tour of our codebase and best practices. The product changes increase in scope and ambiguity from simple copy changes to the delivery of a prominent, impactful feature. Your manager will do a 30, 60, and 90-day review to give feedback and calibrate on how we work together.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">It’s a team effort to get you successfully onboarded; you’ll have a peer paired with you to answer questions, pair program, and check in often to see if you need help. The rest of the team will run training sessions on our culture, product, engineering process, and technical architecture.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1><strong>Technology Stack</strong></h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">I’m sharing our tech stack with the caveat that we don’t require previous experience in it (but a love of typed languages is helpful 😀): TypeScript (frontend &amp; backend), React, GraphQL API, Node.js, Postgres, Redis.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">When they joined Ashby, many of our engineers switched from other languages like Swift and Kotlin (<a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://linkedin.com/in/benasher44/\"><u>Ben</u></a>), platforms like iOS (<a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/tom-quist-0925a199/\"><u>Tom</u></a>) and Windows (<a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/sergeygalich/\"><u>Sergey</u></a>). We care more about fundamentals (e.g., debugging, abstractions) and how fast you learn. For folks on the team who switched, it's nice seeing changes hot reload versus waiting for XCode to compile 😅.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1><strong>Benefits</strong></h1><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Competitive salary and equity.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">10-year exercise window for stock options. You shouldn’t feel pressure to purchase stock options if you leave Ashby —do it when you feel financially comfortable.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Unlimited PTO, and we will encourage you to take it.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">A minimum of 12 weeks of fully paid parental leave, covered by Ashby. For folks outside the US, it may be longer to be in line with regional requirements.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Generous equipment, software, and office furniture budget. Get what you need to be happy and productive!</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">$100/month education budget with more expensive items (like conferences) covered with manager approval.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">If you’re in the US, we offer top-tier health insurance for you and your dependents, with 100% of premiums covered by Ashby. In other countries, we provide high-quality supplemental health insurance for you and your dependents, also fully covered by us.</p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Ashby’s success hinges on hiring great people and creating an environment where we can be happy, feel challenged, and do our best work. We’re being deliberate about building that environment from the ground up. I hope that excites you enough to apply.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>Ashby provides equal employment opportunities (EEO) to all employees and applicants for employment without regard to race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability, genetics, sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression. We are committed to a diverse and inclusive workforce and welcome people from all backgrounds, experiences, perspectives, and abilities.</em></p>",

So, we built and continue to build Ashby to give TA teams the highest standard of tooling. Software that’s intelligent and powerful. Software that provides insights into where they’re failing and automates or simplifies many of the tasks they’re underwater with. We want other functions and departments to be jealous of what TA teams can do with Ashby, and today they often are!\n\n\nWHY YOU SHOULD OR SHOULDN’T APPLY\n\nSoftware engineers come in many flavors, not all of which fit our model. Here are some things to help you decide if this fits you and what you’re looking for:\n\n - You’re not afraid to tackle any part of a technology stack. You do what’s necessary to successfully deliver a feature, whether writing frontend or choosing new infrastructure. We’ll provide a supportive environment to do it successfully (e.g., design system, SRE team).\n\n - You’ve tackled projects with a lot of product and technical ambiguity, and you thrive at the intersection of the two. We’re not building a simple CRUD app, and many of the challenges we tackle require you to use your knowledge of our customers to build powerful abstractions and flexibility in the system to solve a class of problems.\n\n - You know how to strike the right balance between speed and quality. Ashby wasn’t built quickly. We took four years to launch publicly because convincing customers to switch required a high-quality product. However, time isn’t infinite, especially for a startup, so we still move with urgency—we’ve built the equivalent of three or more VC-backed startups with a very small team.\n\n - You are ambitious and always looking to improve your skills. For most engineers, this role will give you more freedom and responsibilities than you’ve experienced in the past. To thrive (and level up), you’ll need to be open to feedback (and we give lots of it).\n\n - You’re an excellent collaborator and communicator. Ownership and freedom don’t mean you work in a vacuum. You’ll need to vet your decisions with the appropriate stakeholders, keep them up to date when necessary, and work with other engineers to get your projects across the finish line. Clear and concise communication helps a lot here!\n\n - You seek to create leverage in your work. The nature of software is that you can often automate or abstract what would be tedious, time-consuming work. Your impatience usually leads to new abstractions, tools to allow Support to debug before Engineering, new lint rules to prevent common bugs, etc.\n\nPut another way, you shouldn’t apply if:\n\n - You need company-driven process and structure to get your projects across the finish line. Sprint planning and well-defined project management processes are things you need or look to others to lead. You’d rather focus on the technical details and challenges.\n\n - You only want to do exciting work. We’re building a team of kind, collaborative folks. Customer issues and investigations are distributed across the team, including our high-level ICs.\n\n - You can get lost in the details. Once you start implementation, it can be hard to take a step back and think about the project as a whole. You like everything to be planned upfront.\n\n - You haven’t led or taken ownership of projects before. You’re used to working with tech leads and taking on tasks distributed by them.\n\n - You want to mentor earlier-career engineers. We rely on engineers owning their projects, so we need engineers with that experience. This requires the team to be reasonably tenured. More than 90% of the team would be considered Senior or above in the industry today, so mentorship opportunities are very limited.\n\n - To you, a tech lead, staff, or principal engineer is someone who spends most of their time project managing or doing architecture reviews. Our most tenured engineers spend most of their time building, and we often trust them with our most challenging problems. While they lead product and technical areas and help other engineers plan their most challenging work, it’s not a requirement, nor do engineers need their sign-off.\n\n\nENGINEERING CULTURE\n\nOur engineering culture is motivated by Benji’s (my Co-founder and CEO) and my belief that a small, talented team, given the right environment, can build high-quality software fast (and work regular hours!). We do it through:\n\n - Minimal process with ownership over decisions normally made by product and design\n\n - Natural collaboration and deliberate communication\n\n - Investing in tools and abstractions that give us leverage\n\n - Putting effort into building a diverse team\n\n\nMINIMAL PROCESS & LOTS OF OWNERSHIP\n\nThe best engineers we’ve worked with delivered reliably magical outcomes. They took customer problems and relentlessly drove them to solutions that were not only successful but often brilliant and creative. While they did this with minimal oversight, stakeholders were never in the dark as to what was going on, and no setback was a surprise.\n\nTraditional product-development processes aren’t meant for the best engineers. Their purpose is to create consistent outcomes regardless of the engineer’s skill. But, consistency comes at the expense of an engineer’s time and freedom—both ingredients necessary to generate those magical outcomes. As a result, process stifles the best engineers and doesn’t give others the opportunity to practice the behaviors that made the best engineers the “best.”\n\nAt Ashby, we want to build an environment that encourages every engineer to be their best. So, at Ashby, every Engineer runs their project. Product Managers (and Designers) build strategy, do customer research, and hand off problem briefs to Engineers. Engineers take on the rest: they research the problem, write product specs, build wireframes, and implement their solution end-to-end. We rely on engineers, not process, to push information outward to the relevant folks (e.g., Product Managers) and pull folks in to help (e.g., Designers, Infra). It’s a new level of ownership for many engineers, but we’d rather an engineer fail a bit and coach up their skills than use process as a crutch. Not everyone succeeds in our culture, but those who do thrive.\n\n\nCOLLABORATION IS NATURAL & COMMUNICATION IS DELIBERATE\n\nOur engineering team consists of lifelong learners who are talented but also humble and kind (meet them here https://www.ashbyhq.com/team!). These attributes create an environment where collaboration happens naturally. We combine this with research, prototyping, and written proposals to see around corners and get feedback from the team across time zones. Focus time is something that we hold sacred, and, with thoughtful and deliberate communication, engineers are in <2h meetings per week (I wrote about it here https://www.ashbyhq.com/blog/company/thoughtful-communication).\n\nTo drive it home, here's a recent calendar of an engineer who has been with us for over 4 years:\n\n[https://app.ashbyhq.com/api/images/user-content/4ea5f68e-c33e-4ac9-831a-e732bee4a303/d4679311-9dba-4031-bf5e-19ce78597ab1/calendar.png]\n\nWe also meet in person at least twice a year, once as a department and once as a company. You also have a small budget to meet up with folks in your city/region.\n\n\nINCREASE LEVERAGE, NOT TEAM SIZE\n\nWe built Ashby with the quality, breadth, and depth that many customers would expect from much larger teams over larger time scales. We’ve done this through investment in:\n\n - Great developer tooling. Our CI/CD takes ~10m, and we deploy at least 15x a day. A debugger that works out of the box. Everyone on the team has contributed to our developer experience 💪🏾.\n\n - Building blocks to create powerful and customizable products fast. At the core of Ashby is a set of common components (analytics modeling and query language, policy engine, workflow engine, design system) that we constantly improve. Each improvement to a common component cascades throughout our app (short video below).\n\nHere’s an impromptu quote from Arjun in our company Slack of what it’s like to build a feature at Ashby:\n\n[https://app.ashbyhq.com/api/images/user-content/4ea5f68e-c33e-4ac9-831a-e732bee4a303/8d94727a-46d8-42a2-9627-ddcd7f822f95/arjun.png]\n\nAnd a demo of one of these building blocks:\n\n\nPUT EFFORT INTO DIVERSITY\n\nDiverse teams drive innovation and better outcomes. Having seen my mother and partner build their careers as minority women in non-diverse fields, I want to make sure Ashby creates opportunities for the next generation of engineers from underrepresented groups.\n\nToday, 21% of engineers at Ashby are from underrepresented groups. It’s not great, and we are taking conscious steps to improve, like sourcing diverse candidates, providing generous paid family leave, no leetcode interviews, and more.\n\n\nINTERVIEW PROCESS\n\nAt Ashby, our team and interview process want to help you show your best self. We’ll dive into past projects and simulate working together via pair programming, writing product and tech specs collaboratively, and talking through decisions. There are no leetcode or whiteboard exercises.\n\nOur interview process is three rounds:\n\n 1. Introduction call with Hiring Manager (15 to 30m, live)\n\n 2. A technical screen where we pair in our actual codebase (1h, live)\n\n 3. Three non-coding interviews that focus on product thinking, technical design, and infrastructure (3h 15m, live can be split across multiple days)\n\nDepending on our leadership team’s bandwidth, we may start with an additional 30m screen with a recruiter.\n\nYour hiring manager will be your main point of contact and prep you for interviews. Each round will have written guidance so you know what to expect (you’ll need minimal preparation). You’ll meet 4 to 6 people in engineering (with 5-15 minutes in each interview to ask them questions). If we don’t give an offer, we’ll provide feedback!\n\n\nYOUR FIRST THREE MONTHS AT ASHBY\n\nWe want an exceptional onboarding experience for every new hire. At Ashby, your dev environment is set up with a single script, you push your first product change on day one, and you spend the rest of your time shipping product changes that give you a tour of our codebase and best practices. The product changes increase in scope and ambiguity from simple copy changes to the delivery of a prominent, impactful feature. Your manager will do a 30, 60, and 90-day review to give feedback and calibrate on how we work together.\n\nIt’s a team effort to get you successfully onboarded; you’ll have a peer paired with you to answer questions, pair program, and check in often to see if you need help. The rest of the team will run training sessions on our culture, product, engineering process, and technical architecture.\n\n\nTECHNOLOGY STACK\n\nI’m sharing our tech stack with the caveat that we don’t require previous experience in it (but a love of typed languages is helpful 😀): TypeScript (frontend & backend), React, GraphQL API, Node.js, Postgres, Redis.\n\nWhen they joined Ashby, many of our engineers switched from other languages like Swift and Kotlin (Ben https://linkedin.com/in/benasher44/), platforms like iOS (Tom https://www.linkedin.com/in/tom-quist-0925a199/) and Windows (Sergey https://www.linkedin.com/in/sergeygalich/). We care more about fundamentals (e.g., debugging, abstractions) and how fast you learn. For folks on the team who switched, it's nice seeing changes hot reload versus waiting for XCode to compile 😅.\n\n\nBENEFITS\n\n - Competitive salary and equity.\n\n - 10-year exercise window for stock options. You shouldn’t feel pressure to purchase stock options if you leave Ashby —do it when you feel financially comfortable.\n\n - Unlimited PTO, and we will encourage you to take it.\n\n - A minimum of 12 weeks of fully paid parental leave, covered by Ashby. For folks outside the US, it may be longer to be in line with regional requirements.\n\n - Generous equipment, software, and office furniture budget. Get what you need to be happy and productive!\n\n - $100/month education budget with more expensive items (like conferences) covered with manager approval.\n\n - If you’re in the US, we offer top-tier health insurance for you and your dependents, with 100% of premiums covered by Ashby. In other countries, we provide high-quality supplemental health insurance for you and your dependents, also fully covered by us.\n\nAshby’s success hinges on hiring great people and creating an environment where we can be happy, feel challenged, and do our best work. We’re being deliberate about building that environment from the ground up. I hope that excites you enough to apply.\n\nAshby provides equal employment opportunities (EEO) to all employees and applicants for employment without regard to race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability, genetics, sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression.

We have thousands of amazing customers including Snowflake, OpenAI, Shopify, Ramp, Notion, and Zapier (and many others who we cannot name!).\n\nWe have a clear buyer persona and large target market. Plus, we already have multiple products to sell. Revenue and headcount is growing 100% Y/Y and we've only taken the first steps towards a much larger opportunity. In short, it's the perfect time to join! 🚀\n\n\nABOUT THIS ROLE\n\nYou will help us win Enterprise (1,000+ employees) accounts by managing the full sales cycle from pipeline generation through to won. You can expect to own a curated list of excellent fit, high propensity accounts as well as a geographic territory with significant market opportunity.\n\nIn this role, you'll primarily focus on new logo acquisition via a healthy mix of inbound and outbound, while also covering a small number of customer accounts for expansion and upsell. Our emphasis is on your ability to excel in the areas listed below and your appetite for continuous growth & improvement.\n\n\nROLE REQUIREMENTS:\n\n - You have a multi-year track record of exceeding $1M+ quotas, selling complex SaaS technologies to large organizations\n\n - You have closed many $100K+ ARR sales which require consensus building and executive engagement.\n\n - You have a demonstrated ability to win highly competitive opportunities by identifying pain and business impacts and connecting those to strategic initiatives of the leadership team\n\n - You are a hunter at heart and are comfortable self-sourcing a majority of your own pipeline\n\n - You have a growth mindset and are excited to tackle the challenges of a high growth startup\n\n\nYOU COULD BE A GREAT FIT IF:\n\n - 📣 You demonstrate mastery of clear communication. You ask questions with precision and can explain complex concepts in simple terms. You eschew business jargon.\n\n - 🏔️ You skillfully guide prospects through their entire buying process—engaging the right stakeholders at the right time to create consensus for a strategic technology decision.\n\n - 🤓 You become both a product and industry expert. You create ‘Ah ha!’ moments in collaboration with your Solutions Engineer to build momentum & solve customer-specific challenges.\n\n - 🔍 Your peers describe you as detail oriented. You send timely & crisp follow-up emails. You take pride in internal operations, like real-time CRM updates.\n\n - 🤝 You have strong business acumen. You help customers connect the dots between technical problems and their business impact. You craft compelling cases for change.\n\n - 💰 You're excited to land the biggest deals we've ever done. You are diligent and gritty and have demonstrated perseverance to win long, competitive sales cycles.\n\n - ⚙️ You're a creative problem solver and comfortable with some healthy ambiguity. You'll help us refine our Enterprise go-to-market motion to maximize the segment's results over time.\n\n - ✈️ You're willing to travel for company events, customer meet ups and on-sites.\n\n\nYOU MAY NOT BE A GREAT FIT IF:\n\n - 🤫 You dislike prospecting. Enterprise reps at Ashby are responsible for sourcing half or more of their pipeline to complement our robust inbound lead flow.\n\n - 💻 You prefer to leave demos \"to the experts.\" While you can expect Solutions Engineering support, our most successful AEs are those with strong curiosity and deep product acumen.\n\n - 💼 You're more of a relationship builder who focuses on selling into the install base. This is primarily a new business oriented role.\n\n - 🐺 You're a lone wolf. You prefer to go it alone in your pursuit of new business. We believe in a team-selling sales model.\n\n\nBONUS:\n\n - Familiarity with Talent Acquisition and HR tools and workflows\n\n - A network that includes Heads of Talent you can tap into\n\n\nOUR PHILOSOPHY\n\nHere are a few key points (relevant to the go-to-market side) that should give you an idea of what it is like to work with us:\n\n - We spend a lot of time building best-in-class products since we believe a highly differentiated product is easier to sell.\n\n - We aim to provide both product & industry expertise whenever we interact with prospects and customers.\n\n - We strongly believe that small teams with very talented people (and the right work environment) deliver much better performance than teams with large headcount. We hire and compensate accordingly.\n\n - We value a strong sense of ownership, principled thinking over experience, and thoughtful communication.\n\n\nINTERVIEW PROCESS\n\nOur interview process is thorough — we assess if you are the right fit for Ashby and we will provide ample information for you to determine if Ashby is the right place for you. The process for this role is as follows:\n\n - Intro Call (30 min) - You'll meet with a Recruiter to discuss your fit for the role and address questions about our market and solution.\n\n - Written Exercise - You'll complete a short take home assignment to showcase your outbound muscle.\n\n - Experience Deep Dive (60 min) - You'll walk the Hiring Manager through your career journey in some detail to highlight your experience, achievements, and points of learning to understand how you've developed into the professional you are today.\n\n - Challenge Interview (90 min) - This will be made up of two parts:\n   \n   - Discovery and Demo Role Play (60 min)\n   \n   - Deal Strategy Discussion (30 min)\n\n\nBENEFITS\n\n - Sell a product that our customers are truly excited about https://www.ashbyhq.com/customers.\n\n - Fairly set, achievable quotas. Typically, greater than 65% of AEs are at or above quota.\n\n - Unlimited PTO with four weeks recommended per year\n\n - Generous equipment, software, and office furniture budget. Get what you need to be happy and productive!\n\n - 10-year exercise window for stock options. You shouldn’t feel pressure to purchase stock options if you leave Ashby —do it when you feel financially comfortable.\n\n - $100/month education budget with more expensive items (like conferences) covered with manager approval.\n\n - If you’re in the US, top-notch health insurance for you and your dependents with 100% of all premiums covered by us, Flexible Spending Accounts and 401K match.\n   \n   \n\nWe're in the talent acquisition software business. We run the end-to-end hiring process through our own platform, and ensure a level playing field for all candidates. Reaching out to hiring managers or recruiters directly won't improve your odds of success. Please focus your energy on the quality of your application.\n\nAshby provides equal employment opportunities (EEO) to all employees and applicants for employment without regard to race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability, genetics, sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression.

            "descriptionHtml": "<p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><strong>The closing date for applications is Dec 31st at 5pm PT.</strong> We will review <strong>every</strong> application and speak to the shortlist we make based on the applications.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h2>About this Role: Our First Embedded Data Analyst!</h2><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">👋 Hi, I’m <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/adamantine/\">Kevin</a>. I manage the Data Team and our analytics products at Ashby. As Ashby continues to grow, we are expanding the reach of high-quality analytical work across the company. This role is our first <strong>embedded</strong> Data Analyst: you will be a full member of the Data Team, but your day-to-day priorities will come from our Revenue Operations (RevOps) organization to support the entire Go-to-Market (GTM) function.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">This is <em>not</em> a generic “business analyst” role - this is a modern Data Analyst role requiring fluency in the data warehouse, strong analytical rigor, and the ability to work end-to-end (from raw or lightly modeled data through final insight, modeling adjustments, and BI deliverables). Your analytical standards, modeling practices, and approach to problem-solving will be developed and maintained in close partnership with the Data Team, while your project portfolio will be shaped by RevOps.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">As an embedded analyst, you will serve as the analytical counterpart to RevOps leadership: helping to scope business questions, build robust data assets, design metrics and dashboards, and communicate insights that influence GTM strategy. A strong working knowledge of GTM motions in B2B SaaS will help you excel, though deep curiosity and strong fundamentals can also make up the difference.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Because this role sits at the intersection of RevOps and the Data Team, you’ll have broad ownership and visibility across domains. You will work on everything from revenue funnel diagnostics and sales efficiency analyses to marketing cohort performance, capacity planning, retention/expansion patterns, and operational metrics that help our GTM leaders run the business. You will also contribute to the underlying data models and help mature the analytical operating system for GTM at Ashby.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">If you’re a technically strong Data Analyst who enjoys owning the full analytical lifecycle, partnering directly with business stakeholders, and improving the modeling and data products that sustain an organization, this role will be an excellent fit. </p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h2>Requirements</h2><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">The essence of this role dictates that you must be analytical, conversant in statistical reasoning, and capable of managing the data you work with from inception through synthesis of results in the appropriate downstream assets. There are a lot of ways to meet those responsibilities. If the dot product of your skill vector with this requirements vector is close to 1, please consider applying, but please note it does not have to be 1.0. </p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Expertise in SQL-based data analysis</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Strong in analytical and statistical thinking - you must be able to generate insights</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Expertise with data visualization (i.e. visual communication of results)</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Interest in working directly with business partners, i.e. go-to-market stakeholders, to identify and plan related analysis efforts</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Proficiency building internal “data products” based on your analysis results, e.g. high-usage dashboards via BI tools (Looker, Tableau, etc) for various business partners</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Excellent written and verbal communication. Ashby has a writing-centric culture, but you will also be responsible for direct collaboration with various teammates</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Very detail-oriented: in your analysis work you can anticipate complications and identify bad-but-not-obviously-wrong data discrepancies</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Proficiency in Python (primarily in the domain of data analysis and visualization)</p></li></ul><h3>You could be a great fit if</h3><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You identify as exceptionally curious by nature</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You want to operate as a true Data Analyst embedded in a business function—combining stakeholder-facing work with deep technical execution</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You could pass as an “analytics engineer” or have working proficiency in dbt-based data modeling</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You have been a first or early data analyst at a growing, fast-moving startup</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You have strong working knowledge of GTM motions in B2B SaaS: sales, marketing, customer success, pipeline forecasting, and revenue analytics</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You have an intuition for solving problems pragmatically and an eye for leverage</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You enjoy collaboration and find reward in enabling other teammates to succeed</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You have strong, experience-backed opinions about data products and data culture in a company setting</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Familiarity with our data stack is a bonus, but not a requirement</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Have a passion for refining the role of data within company environments, spanning everything from communication standards and data request management - you’ll help shape this as Ashby grows</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You can appreciate the whole distribution as much as a point estimator</p></li></ul><h3>Reasons not to apply</h3><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Spreadsheet-only analytical backgrounds are not a match for this role; fluency with SQL in a modern data warehouse is essential.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You do not enjoy working directly with non-analysts or other business stakeholders. This role will require working closely with teammates across the company as various data-related needs come up.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You are looking for consumer-scale data infrastructure projects. We have a huge and interesting set of data to work with (check out our data trends reports!), but we are a B2B SaaS company. Relative to B2C services, we might best be considered small but mighty :)</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You are seeking an in-person work experience. Although there are hot spots of Ashby employees around the world, Ashby is a remote workplace. Rest assured, we do meet up in person for various events throughout the year!</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You want to be on a large team of analysts. The Data Team at Ashby is extremely lean, so you will be primarily working with a data engineering partner, our first data analyst, and your manager (me!). That said, you will be working directly with many team members across the company, so your teammates in the analysis sense will be the diversity of folks you collaborate with from project to project.</p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h2>Data Culture at Ashby</h2><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">At Ashby, we draw a clear distinction between when to look to data for \"the answer\" and when to use data to aid principled thinking for decision making. In general, a primary consideration is whether or not data is needed to help clarify points of uncertainty. When data is considered necessary, a secondary consideration is to what depth data will be required. Data questions lend themselves to ongoing \"what about...\" or \"what if...\" explorations, which can be important in some situations but are not always necessary. <br /><br />With these dynamics in mind, we do not foster an environment where every decision we make should be backed by data, but we do foster an environment where teammates ask whether or not data will fit the task at hand well. This, in turn, allows us to operate a lean team focused on projects where data provides true leverage to our overall business and product goals.<br /><br />As a related but distinct point, Ashby’s data culture, as far as transparency and access goes, is very open. We share company-wide access to our financial standings, progress, goals, and generally make any data and reporting results broadly available. Outside of constraints related to whether a teammate has access to a particular tool, there are close to no constraints on access the state of the company as told by data or reporting.

We will review every application and speak to the shortlist we make based on the applications.\n\n\nABOUT THIS ROLE: OUR FIRST EMBEDDED DATA ANALYST!\n\n👋 Hi, I’m Kevin https://www.linkedin.com/in/adamantine/. I manage the Data Team and our analytics products at Ashby. As Ashby continues to grow, we are expanding the reach of high-quality analytical work across the company. This role is our first embedded Data Analyst: you will be a full member of the Data Team, but your day-to-day priorities will come from our Revenue Operations (RevOps) organization to support the entire Go-to-Market (GTM) function.\n\nThis is not a generic “business analyst” role - this is a modern Data Analyst role requiring fluency in the data warehouse, strong analytical rigor, and the ability to work end-to-end (from raw or lightly modeled data through final insight, modeling adjustments, and BI deliverables). Your analytical standards, modeling practices, and approach to problem-solving will be developed and maintained in close partnership with the Data Team, while your project portfolio will be shaped by RevOps.\n\nAs an embedded analyst, you will serve as the analytical counterpart to RevOps leadership: helping to scope business questions, build robust data assets, design metrics and dashboards, and communicate insights that influence GTM strategy. A strong working knowledge of GTM motions in B2B SaaS will help you excel, though deep curiosity and strong fundamentals can also make up the difference.\n\nBecause this role sits at the intersection of RevOps and the Data Team, you’ll have broad ownership and visibility across domains. You will work on everything from revenue funnel diagnostics and sales efficiency analyses to marketing cohort performance, capacity planning, retention/expansion patterns, and operational metrics that help our GTM leaders run the business. You will also contribute to the underlying data models and help mature the analytical operating system for GTM at Ashby.\n\nIf you’re a technically strong Data Analyst who enjoys owning the full analytical lifecycle, partnering directly with business stakeholders, and improving the modeling and data products that sustain an organization, this role will be an excellent fit.\n\n\nREQUIREMENTS\n\nThe essence of this role dictates that you must be analytical, conversant in statistical reasoning, and capable of managing the data you work with from inception through synthesis of results in the appropriate downstream assets. There are a lot of ways to meet those responsibilities. If the dot product of your skill vector with this requirements vector is close to 1, please consider applying, but please note it does not have to be 1.0.\n\n - Expertise in SQL-based data analysis\n\n - Strong in analytical and statistical thinking - you must be able to generate insights\n\n - Expertise with data visualization (i.e. visual communication of results)\n\n - Interest in working directly with business partners, i.e. go-to-market stakeholders, to identify and plan related analysis efforts\n\n - Proficiency building internal “data products” based on your analysis results, e.g. high-usage dashboards via BI tools (Looker, Tableau, etc) for various business partners\n\n - Excellent written and verbal communication. Ashby has a writing-centric culture, but you will also be responsible for direct collaboration with various teammates\n\n - Very detail-oriented: in your analysis work you can anticipate complications and identify bad-but-not-obviously-wrong data discrepancies\n\n - Proficiency in Python (primarily in the domain of data analysis and visualization)\n\n\nYOU COULD BE A GREAT FIT IF\n\n - You identify as exceptionally curious by nature\n\n - You want to operate as a true Data Analyst embedded in a business function—combining stakeholder-facing work with deep technical execution\n\n - You could pass as an “analytics engineer” or have working proficiency in dbt-based data modeling\n\n - You have been a first or early data analyst at a growing, fast-moving startup\n\n - You have strong working knowledge of GTM motions in B2B SaaS: sales, marketing, customer success, pipeline forecasting, and revenue analytics\n\n - You have an intuition for solving problems pragmatically and an eye for leverage\n\n - You enjoy collaboration and find reward in enabling other teammates to succeed\n\n - You have strong, experience-backed opinions about data products and data culture in a company setting\n\n - Familiarity with our data stack is a bonus, but not a requirement\n\n - Have a passion for refining the role of data within company environments, spanning everything from communication standards and data request management - you’ll help shape this as Ashby grows\n\n - You can appreciate the whole distribution as much as a point estimator\n\n\nREASONS NOT TO APPLY\n\n - Spreadsheet-only analytical backgrounds are not a match for this role; fluency with SQL in a modern data warehouse is essential.\n\n - You do not enjoy working directly with non-analysts or other business stakeholders. This role will require working closely with teammates across the company as various data-related needs come up.\n\n - You are looking for consumer-scale data infrastructure projects. We have a huge and interesting set of data to work with (check out our data trends reports!), but we are a B2B SaaS company. Relative to B2C services, we might best be considered small but mighty :)\n\n - You are seeking an in-person work experience. Although there are hot spots of Ashby employees around the world, Ashby is a remote workplace. Rest assured, we do meet up in person for various events throughout the year!\n\n - You want to be on a large team of analysts. The Data Team at Ashby is extremely lean, so you will be primarily working with a data engineering partner, our first data analyst, and your manager (me!). That said, you will be working directly with many team members across the company, so your teammates in the analysis sense will be the diversity of folks you collaborate with from project to project.\n\n\nDATA CULTURE AT ASHBY\n\nAt Ashby, we draw a clear distinction between when to look to data for \"the answer\" and when to use data to aid principled thinking for decision making. In general, a primary consideration is whether or not data is needed to help clarify points of uncertainty. When data is considered necessary, a secondary consideration is to what depth data will be required. Data questions lend themselves to ongoing \"what about...\" or \"what if...\" explorations, which can be important in some situations but are not always necessary.\n\nWith these dynamics in mind, we do not foster an environment where every decision we make should be backed by data, but we do foster an environment where teammates ask whether or not data will fit the task at hand well. This, in turn, allows us to operate a lean team focused on projects where data provides true leverage to our overall business and product goals.\n\nAs a related but distinct point, Ashby’s data culture, as far as transparency and access goes, is very open. We share company-wide access to our financial standings, progress, goals, and generally make any data and reporting results broadly available. Outside of constraints related to whether a teammate has access to a particular tool, there are close to no constraints on access the state of the company as told by data or reporting. In general, we would like to continue and extend open access to data throughout the company (with your help!), but with consideration and not as a substitute for principled thinking :)\n\n\nASHBY'S DATA STACK\n\nAs it will undoubtedly be a point of interest, a quick summary of our data stack is provided here.

            "descriptionHtml": "<p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We’re looking for a curious, rigorous, problem-hungry platform engineer (who codes!) to carry the ball as we bring Ashby to the big leagues. Ashby builds software that lets talent teams build an efficient, delightful, respectful hiring process. Similarly, you’re an engineer who wants to build a “paved road” that excellent engineering teams can safely take to the moon and back.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We have notable customers like Notion, Linear, Shopify, and Snowflake. Our growth and retention metrics are best-in-class among our peers: we have tens of millions in ARR, growing &gt;100% year over year, over 2500 customers, very low churn, and many years of runway. We’ll share more details once we meet, but you now probably have a good idea as to why we're hiring for this role 😅.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We’ve listed this role twice: as a Platform Engineer and Site Reliability Engineer – our team does both, and we are open to candidates who lean towards one or the other. </p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1>About the role and how we work</h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Hi 👋 I’m<a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://uk.linkedin.com/in/colinhoweuk\"> <u>Colin</u></a>, Head of EMEA Engineering. I’ve spent a number of years leading engineering teams in startups, and that has always included being close to infrastructure teams - no matter what name they’ve worn (SRE, infrastructure, platform, etc). I’ve got my hands dirty building the initial infrastructure for startups and know the value a talented infrastructure engineer brings. The rigour, the discipline, the peace and quiet when everything just <em>hums along</em>.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Our infrastructure is in a good place <em>for now</em>. Nothing is static. Ashby continues to grow rapidly, putting strain on our existing infrastructure. We’re always looking to give our customers more powerful hiring software, and building new product features often requires new pieces of infrastructure.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Having herded plenty of <em>snowflakeservers</em> in the past, I’ve learned there’s a better way. I (and Ashby) place a lot of value on infrastructure-as-code. As a Platform Engineer at Ashby, you’ll get to dive into scaling problems, add new capabilities to our platform, and think about how our entire team interacts with infrastructure. All our own engineers own their projects end-to-end and ship with minimal oversight. We don’t put roadblocks to ensure security when common sense will do and we don’t build processes like change management boards around the lowest common denominator. But with great power comes great responsibility: we handle personal and confidential data about some of the biggest decisions we ever make at work. As we grow, more and bigger customers rely on us to be reliable and secure and how we operate internally will need to evolve.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We’re at an inflection point where our ability to scale and deliver a seamless experience has a make-or-break impact – we have some of the fastest growing companies using our platform every day to hire hundreds of people per month. We need someone like you to make good decisions, debug thorny issues, and build us a future-proof platform that can withstand this scale. Our small but mighty infrastructure team has set up a secure and simple environment (we don’t believe in spinning up a new service unless necessary!) for our growing product team to build in. That’s where you come in: you, too, will own projects end-to-end and have an impact on core parts of the Ashby developer and user experience. For instance, you could work on:</p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Optimize <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://www.loom.com/share/32c0cc3eedf2450fb66a901b76186ce4\"><u>our homegrown ultra-dynamic recruiting DSL-to-SQL compiler</u></a>, and create tools to help developers do so</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Create automated guardrails for the security and privacy of our customer data</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Help our developers ship features fast through canary deploys, gradual rollouts and feature flags, while keeping complexity manageable and reducing downtime</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Work with the business and the engineering team to define SLOs and implement the corresponding SLIs.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Ensure all communication with external services supports retries and circuit-breakers.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Implement the infrastructure to support an event-driven architecture and data warehouse.</p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We’re looking for someone who can build systems that an engineer would like to work with: mature and boring but open-minded and approachable. We have to balance reliability with flexibility. Software and its availability are now mission critical to almost every working professional. To be in an SRE in today’s world, you have to be extremely comfortable evaluating risk, those you take and those others take.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1>Why you should or shouldn’t apply</h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You should apply if:</p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You never stop. You get weirdly obsessed about a problem that doesn’t yet make sense, turn it every which way in your head until the explanation dawns. You’ll search every rock, inventory every clue, hunt every mismatch. We do that, too - together we’ll be armed with state-of-the-art monitoring tools and an impressive amount of data, and join you in the adventure.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You don’t take shortcuts. You’re speaking up for the future user, the edge case, the doomsday design. You know product engineers want to build it with you, and see them as allies, where you give them the power and knowledge to access greater things.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You’re someone who cares about what you do and the team you do it with, and want to work with others who do as well. You’ll be on interview panels choosing your next colleagues, and you’ll take that seriously. You only want to work with people who make you better, and want to make you better.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You’ve built infrastructure at a slightly later stage than Ashby is at - you know how to deal with millions of data points, have seen great (or not great) infrastructure make or break customer experience, and have automated everything from provisioning to monitoring and release process.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You’re a Swiss army knife (all nationalities welcome ;) ). You’ll get every hard problem the company faces. You’ll get to do infrastructure updates, security enforcements, database optimization, Kubernetes debugging, and digging through Typescript traces figuring out what doesn’t work. You probably don’t feel like an expert at at least some of that... and that appeals to you.</p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">All that makes for a pretty specific kind of role, and the job isn’t to everyone’s tastes! You should not apply if:</p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You don’t want to make your own decisions on what is the best paved road to build for Ashby, and expect a lead or manager to make the final call on what that is. Our leads (and managers) give ample commentary and feedback on technical decisions and how they’re made, but you ship what you want to build and are accountable for it.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You hate SQL. We have a lot of features built around making the best out of data, and our platform engineers also sometimes dive into a gnarly report or advise engineers on a more performant data model to use.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You don’t want to code. Our SREs are some of our best software engineers and they are just as responsible for the application as the other engineering teams - albeit at a platform level. Reviewing code and submitting code changes will be part of your day to day.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Your primary mode of communicating best practices to engineers is live meetings. We’re a very async culture and written communication (and code) is how changes get made. As an Ashby SRE, you will need to share new tooling and best practices with engineers faster than your next meeting opportunity will take you.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You’ve never delivered a project, on your own, without someone prodding you for updates. We have no project or delivery managers to fill your calendar with busy work, but the flip side is you have to do your project management, seek the help you need to get unstuck and cut scope when it’s worthwhile.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p></li></ul><h1>Technology Stack</h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">I’m sharing our tech stack with the caveat that we don’t require previous experience in it: TypeScript (frontend &amp; backend), Node.js, React, Apollo GraphQL, Postgres, Redis.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We use Datadog and Sentry on 100% cloud-based (AWS) infra. We take developer experience and reliability seriously: all engineers are on call in a follow-the-sun model, and everyone contributes to developer tooling.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1>What We’re Building</h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">As engineers, we are used to tooling that makes us <strong>better</strong> at what we do. When we started Ashby, we saw the opposite with Talent Acquisition software. Recruiting teams were leveling up how they did their work, but instead of software meeting this new standard, it held them back.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Scheduling a final round is an excellent example. Recruiting teams wanted to schedule candidates faster, track interviewer preparation and quality, and do it with half the headcount. A recruiter needed to manually collect availability from the candidate, identify qualified interviewers, perform “Calendar Tetris” to find who is available to interview the candidate, schedule on the earliest date possible, and make any last-minute adjustments as availability changed. They must do this while considering the interview load on each individual and whether interviewers need to be trained and shadowing others. 🥵 TA software didn’t help.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">As hiring managers, we know TA is a critical function, and as engineers, we know software can do better. So, we built and continue to build Ashby to give TA teams the <em>highest</em> standard of tooling. Software that’s intelligent and powerful.

We want other functions and departments to be jealous of what TA teams can do with Ashby, and today they often are!</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1>Engineering Culture</h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Our engineering culture is motivated by <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/abhikpramanik/\"><u>Abhik</u></a> and <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/benjaminencz/\"><u>Benji</u></a>’s (our co-founders) belief that a small talented team, given the right environment, can build high-quality software fast (and work regular hours!). We do it through:</p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Minimal process with ownership over decisions normally made by product and design</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Natural collaboration and deliberate communication</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Investing in tools and abstractions that give us leverage</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Putting effort into building a diverse team</p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h2><strong>Minimal Process &amp; Lots of Ownership</strong></h2><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">The best engineers we’ve worked with delivered reliably magical outcomes. They took customer problems and relentlessly drove them to solutions that were not only successful but often brilliant and creative. While they did this with minimal oversight, stakeholders were never in the dark as to what was going on, and no setback was a surprise.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Traditional product-development processes aren’t meant for the best engineers. Their purpose is to create consistent outcomes regardless of the engineer’s skill. But, consistency comes at the expense of an engineer’s time and freedom—both ingredients necessary to generate those magical outcomes. As a result, process stifles the best engineers and doesn’t give others the opportunity to practice the behaviors that made the best engineers the “best.”</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">At Ashby, we want to build an environment that encourages every engineer to be their best. So, at Ashby, every Engineer runs their project. Product Managers (and Designers) build strategy, do customer research, and hand off problem briefs to Engineers. Engineers take on the rest: they research the problem, write product specs, build wireframes, and implement their solution end-to-end. We rely on engineers, not process, to push information outward to the relevant folks (e.g., Product Managers) and pull folks in to help (e.g., Designers, Infra). It’s a new level of ownership for many engineers, but we’d rather an engineer fail a bit and coach up their skills than use process as a crutch. Not everyone succeeds in our culture, but those who do <em>thrive</em>.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h2><strong>Collaboration is Natural &amp; Communication is Deliberate</strong></h2><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Our engineering team consists of lifelong learners who are talented but also humble and kind (meet them <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://www.ashbyhq.com/team\"><u>here</u></a>!). These attributes create an environment where collaboration happens naturally. We combine this with research, prototyping, and written proposals to see around corners and get feedback from the team across time zones. Focus time is something that we hold sacred, and, with thoughtful and deliberate communication, engineers are in &lt;2h meetings per week (Abhik wrote about it <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://www.ashbyhq.com/blog/company/thoughtful-communication\"><u>here</u></a>).</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">To drive it home, here's a recent calendar of an engineer who has been with us for over 4 years:</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><div style=\"text-align:left\"><img style=\"max-width:100%\" src=\"https://app.ashbyhq.com/api/images/user-content/4ea5f68e-c33e-4ac9-831a-e732bee4a303/d4679311-9dba-4031-bf5e-19ce78597ab1/calendar.png\" /></div><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We also meet in person at least twice a year, once as a department and once as a company.

            "descriptionPlain": "We’re looking for a curious, rigorous, problem-hungry platform engineer (who codes!) to carry the ball as we bring Ashby to the big leagues. Ashby builds software that lets talent teams build an efficient, delightful, respectful hiring process. Similarly, you’re an engineer who wants to build a “paved road” that excellent engineering teams can safely take to the moon and back.\n\nWe have notable customers like Notion, Linear, Shopify, and Snowflake. Our growth and retention metrics are best-in-class among our peers: we have tens of millions in ARR, growing >100% year over year, over 2500 customers, very low churn, and many years of runway. We’ll share more details once we meet, but you now probably have a good idea as to why we're hiring for this role 😅.\n\nWe’ve listed this role twice: as a Platform Engineer and Site Reliability Engineer – our team does both, and we are open to candidates who lean towards one or the other.\n\n\nABOUT THE ROLE AND HOW WE WORK\n\nHi 👋 I’m Colin https://uk.linkedin.com/in/colinhoweuk, Head of EMEA Engineering. I’ve spent a number of years leading engineering teams in startups, and that has always included being close to infrastructure teams - no matter what name they’ve worn (SRE, infrastructure, platform, etc). I’ve got my hands dirty building the initial infrastructure for startups and know the value a talented infrastructure engineer brings. The rigour, the discipline, the peace and quiet when everything just hums along.\n\nOur infrastructure is in a good place for now. Nothing is static. Ashby continues to grow rapidly, putting strain on our existing infrastructure. We’re always looking to give our customers more powerful hiring software, and building new product features often requires new pieces of infrastructure.\n\nHaving herded plenty of snowflakeservers in the past, I’ve learned there’s a better way. I (and Ashby) place a lot of value on infrastructure-as-code. As a Platform Engineer at Ashby, you’ll get to dive into scaling problems, add new capabilities to our platform, and think about how our entire team interacts with infrastructure. All our own engineers own their projects end-to-end and ship with minimal oversight. We don’t put roadblocks to ensure security when common sense will do and we don’t build processes like change management boards around the lowest common denominator. But with great power comes great responsibility: we handle personal and confidential data about some of the biggest decisions we ever make at work. As we grow, more and bigger customers rely on us to be reliable and secure and how we operate internally will need to evolve.\n\nWe’re at an inflection point where our ability to scale and deliver a seamless experience has a make-or-break impact – we have some of the fastest growing companies using our platform every day to hire hundreds of people per month. We need someone like you to make good decisions, debug thorny issues, and build us a future-proof platform that can withstand this scale. Our small but mighty infrastructure team has set up a secure and simple environment (we don’t believe in spinning up a new service unless necessary!) for our growing product team to build in. That’s where you come in: you, too, will own projects end-to-end and have an impact on core parts of the Ashby developer and user experience. For instance, you could work on:\n\n - Optimize our homegrown ultra-dynamic recruiting DSL-to-SQL compiler https://www.loom.com/share/32c0cc3eedf2450fb66a901b76186ce4, and create tools to help developers do so\n\n - Create automated guardrails for the security and privacy of our customer data\n\n - Help our developers ship features fast through canary deploys, gradual rollouts and feature flags, while keeping complexity manageable and reducing downtime\n\n - Work with the business and the engineering team to define SLOs and implement the corresponding SLIs.\n\n - Ensure all communication with external services supports retries and circuit-breakers.\n\n - Implement the infrastructure to support an event-driven architecture and data warehouse.\n\nWe’re looking for someone who can build systems that an engineer would like to work with: mature and boring but open-minded and approachable. We have to balance reliability with flexibility. Software and its availability are now mission critical to almost every working professional. To be in an SRE in today’s world, you have to be extremely comfortable evaluating risk, those you take and those others take.\n\n\nWHY YOU SHOULD OR SHOULDN’T APPLY\n\nYou should apply if:\n\n - You never stop. You get weirdly obsessed about a problem that doesn’t yet make sense, turn it every which way in your head until the explanation dawns. You’ll search every rock, inventory every clue, hunt every mismatch. We do that, too - together we’ll be armed with state-of-the-art monitoring tools and an impressive amount of data, and join you in the adventure.\n\n - You don’t take shortcuts. You’re speaking up for the future user, the edge case, the doomsday design. You know product engineers want to build it with you, and see them as allies, where you give them the power and knowledge to access greater things.\n\n - You’re someone who cares about what you do and the team you do it with, and want to work with others who do as well. You’ll be on interview panels choosing your next colleagues, and you’ll take that seriously. You only want to work with people who make you better, and want to make you better.\n\n - You’ve built infrastructure at a slightly later stage than Ashby is at - you know how to deal with millions of data points, have seen great (or not great) infrastructure make or break customer experience, and have automated everything from provisioning to monitoring and release process.\n\n - You’re a Swiss army knife (all nationalities welcome ;) ). You’ll get every hard problem the company faces. You’ll get to do infrastructure updates, security enforcements, database optimization, Kubernetes debugging, and digging through Typescript traces figuring out what doesn’t work. You probably don’t feel like an expert at at least some of that... and that appeals to you.\n\nAll that makes for a pretty specific kind of role, and the job isn’t to everyone’s tastes! You should not apply if:\n\n - You don’t want to make your own decisions on what is the best paved road to build for Ashby, and expect a lead or manager to make the final call on what that is. Our leads (and managers) give ample commentary and feedback on technical decisions and how they’re made, but you ship what you want to build and are accountable for it.\n\n - You hate SQL. We have a lot of features built around making the best out of data, and our platform engineers also sometimes dive into a gnarly report or advise engineers on a more performant data model to use.\n\n - You don’t want to code. Our SREs are some of our best software engineers and they are just as responsible for the application as the other engineering teams - albeit at a platform level. Reviewing code and submitting code changes will be part of your day to day.\n\n - Your primary mode of communicating best practices to engineers is live meetings. We’re a very async culture and written communication (and code) is how changes get made. As an Ashby SRE, you will need to share new tooling and best practices with engineers faster than your next meeting opportunity will take you.\n\n - You’ve never delivered a project, on your own, without someone prodding you for updates. We have no project or delivery managers to fill your calendar with busy work, but the flip side is you have to do your project management, seek the help you need to get unstuck and cut scope when it’s worthwhile.\n\n\nTECHNOLOGY STACK\n\nI’m sharing our tech stack with the caveat that we don’t require previous experience in it: TypeScript (frontend & backend), Node.js, React, Apollo GraphQL, Postgres, Redis.\n\nWe use Datadog and Sentry on 100% cloud-based (AWS) infra. We take developer experience and reliability seriously: all engineers are on call in a follow-the-sun model, and everyone contributes to developer tooling.\n\n\nWHAT WE’RE BUILDING\n\nAs engineers, we are used to tooling that makes us better at what we do. When we started Ashby, we saw the opposite with Talent Acquisition software. Recruiting teams were leveling up how they did their work, but instead of software meeting this new standard, it held them back.\n\nScheduling a final round is an excellent example. Recruiting teams wanted to schedule candidates faster, track interviewer preparation and quality, and do it with half the headcount. A recruiter needed to manually collect availability from the candidate, identify qualified interviewers, perform “Calendar Tetris” to find who is available to interview the candidate, schedule on the earliest date possible, and make any last-minute adjustments as availability changed. They must do this while considering the interview load on each individual and whether interviewers need to be trained and shadowing others. 🥵 TA software didn’t help.\n\nAs hiring managers, we know TA is a critical function, and as engineers, we know software can do better. So, we built and continue to build Ashby to give TA teams the highest standard of tooling. Software that’s intelligent and powerful. Software that provides insights into where they’re failing and automates or simplifies many of the tasks they’re underwater with. We want other functions and departments to be jealous of what TA teams can do with Ashby, and today they often are!\n\n\nENGINEERING CULTURE\n\nOur engineering culture is motivated by Abhik https://www.linkedin.com/in/abhikpramanik/ and Benji https://www.linkedin.com/in/benjaminencz/’s (our co-founders) belief that a small talented team, given the right environment, can build high-quality software fast (and work regular hours!). We do it through:\n\n - Minimal process with ownership over decisions normally made by product and design\n\n - Natural collaboration and deliberate communication\n\n - Investing in tools and abstractions that give us leverage\n\n - Putting effort into building a diverse team\n\n\nMINIMAL PROCESS & LOTS OF OWNERSHIP\n\nThe best engineers we’ve worked with delivered reliably magical outcomes.

These attributes create an environment where collaboration happens naturally. We combine this with research, prototyping, and written proposals to see around corners and get feedback from the team across time zones. Focus time is something that we hold sacred, and, with thoughtful and deliberate communication, engineers are in <2h meetings per week (Abhik wrote about it here https://www.ashbyhq.com/blog/company/thoughtful-communication).\n\nTo drive it home, here's a recent calendar of an engineer who has been with us for over 4 years:\n\n[https://app.ashbyhq.com/api/images/user-content/4ea5f68e-c33e-4ac9-831a-e732bee4a303/d4679311-9dba-4031-bf5e-19ce78597ab1/calendar.png]\n\nWe also meet in person at least twice a year, once as a department and once as a company. You also have a small budget to meet up with folks in your city/region.\n\n\nINCREASE LEVERAGE, NOT TEAM SIZE\n\nWe built Ashby with the quality, breadth, and depth that many customers would expect from much larger teams over larger time scales.

            "descriptionHtml": "<p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Hi 👋🏾 I’m <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/abhikpramanik\"><u>Abhik</u></a>, Ashby's Co-Founder and VP of Engineering. We’re looking for a versatile, persistent product engineer who’s not afraid to set up reusable building blocks across the stack and advocate for the time and space to do so. At Ashby, all our engineers ship features end-to-end at a high pace. Example is the best leadership. We’ll give you the room to do your best work, and you'll be our guide! If that speaks to you, read on.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">What Ashby gives you in return is the best of both early and growth-stage environments. The agency and no-nonsense of a seed startup: you write product specs, make product and design decisions, and build in an almost-no-meeting culture. While also the product-market fit and scale of a growth-stage startup: tens of thousands of daily users who depend on your software and eagerly await your next feature.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We have notable customers like Notion, Linear, Shopify, and Snowflake. Our growth and retention metrics are best-in-class among our peers: we have tens of millions in ARR, growing &gt;100% year over year, very low churn, and many years of runway. We’ll share more details once we meet.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You’ve probably seen this role posted before, and it’s because we’re always expanding the team (we’re on track to double this year). We’re bubbling with ideas on how to support Talent Acquisition through software, and we’ve started the journey of building products beyond Talent Acquisition. We read every application and aim to respond to yours within 3-4 days (often sooner).</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1>About the Role and How We Work</h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Our engineering culture strives to recreate the environments where we did our best work as ICs – where we had the ownership and agency to impact our users with creative and innovative software.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">I started my career building software for artists in the Visual Effects industry. It was a formative experience for me as a software engineer because success relied on my ability to be a product manager and designer. I talked to artists to understand their needs. I came up with ideas. I did industry research, designed interfaces, and prototyped ideas. I watched artists use what I built and decided what to tackle in the next iteration. No daily stand-ups, no t-shirt sizing, no planning meetings.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">I studied computer science to solve problems, not tickets, and this felt exactly like that. I not only felt creative and fulfilled but the agency and ownership we were given as engineers powered an incredible amount of innovation.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Innovation came differently (or not at all) at technology startups beyond the seed stage, often through an engineer’s force of will and ability to push back against culture (rather than any encouragement from it). Engineering was narrowed to implementation and delivery, partly due to the influence of other departments and partly due to the influx of \"Agile\" processes like sprint planning. In those companies, I felt like a JIRA jockey. </p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">At Ashby, we’re building an environment that is optimistic about what engineers can own and achieve. An environment that embraces innovative engineers, and, frankly, often stays out of their way. As a Product Engineer, you’ll take ownership over a large portion of one of our products and own projects end-to-end (wearing hats traditionally worn by product and design). You’ll research competitors, write product specs, make wireframes, and more. To ground it with examples, product engineers at Ashby have:</p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Designed and built automated interview scheduling. This feature automates scheduling by calculating possible times from a pool of interviewers and other constraints, and then presenting these times to the candidate for selection via our responsive web app. This solves the “Calendar Tetris” problem I talk about in \"What We're Building.\"</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Built a generalized declarative filter architecture that allows users to create complex filters for any record with a consistent UI and compile it to SQL in our backend. Many user-facing features use it.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Specced, designed, and implemented a feature that allows users to complete signing offers entirely within Ashby. This project involved talking to customers to understand their requirements, deciding what technologies to use, building a prototype, and working with other team members to integrate the final implementation into additional features.</p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1>What We’re Building</h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">As engineers, we are used to tooling that makes us <strong>better</strong> at what we do. When we started Ashby, we saw the opposite with Talent Acquisition software. Recruiting teams were leveling up how they did their work, but instead of software meeting this new standard, it held them back.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Scheduling a final round is an excellent example. Recruiting teams wanted to schedule candidates faster, track interviewer preparation and quality, and do it with half the headcount. A recruiter needed to manually collect availability from the candidate, identify qualified interviewers, perform “Calendar Tetris” to find who is available to interview the candidate, schedule on the earliest date possible, and make any last-minute adjustments as availability changed. They must do this while considering the interview load on each individual and whether interviewers need to be trained and shadowing others. 🥵 TA software didn’t help.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">As hiring managers, we know TA is a critical function, and as engineers, we know software can do better. So, we built and continue to build Ashby to give TA teams the <em>highest</em> standard of tooling. Software that’s intelligent and powerful. Software that provides insights into where they’re failing and automates or simplifies many of the tasks they’re underwater with. We want other functions and departments to be jealous of what TA teams can do with Ashby, and today they often are!</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1>Why You Should or Shouldn’t Apply</h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Software engineers come in many flavors, not all of which fit our model. Here are some things  to help you decide if this fits you and what you’re looking for:</p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You’re not afraid to tackle any part of a technology stack.</em> You do what’s necessary to successfully deliver a feature, whether writing frontend or choosing new infrastructure. We’ll provide a supportive environment to do it successfully (e.g., design system, SRE team).</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You’ve tackled projects with a lot of product and technical ambiguity, and you thrive at the intersection of the two. </em>We’re not building a simple CRUD app, and many of the challenges we tackle require you to use your knowledge of our customers to build powerful abstractions and flexibility in the system to solve a class of problems.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You know how to strike the right balance between speed and quality. </em>Ashby wasn’t built quickly. We took four years to launch publicly because convincing customers to switch required a high-quality product. However, time isn’t infinite, especially for a startup, so we still move with urgency—we’ve built the equivalent of three or more VC-backed startups with a very small team.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You are ambitious and always looking to improve your skills. </em>For most engineers, this role will give you more freedom and responsibilities than you’ve experienced in the past. To thrive (and level up), you’ll need to be open to feedback (and we give lots of it).</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You’re an excellent collaborator and communicator. </em>Ownership and freedom don’t mean you work in a vacuum. You’ll need to vet your decisions with the appropriate stakeholders, keep them up to date when necessary, and work with other engineers to get your projects across the finish line. Clear and concise communication helps a lot here!</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You seek to create leverage in your work. </em>The nature of software is that you can often automate or abstract what would be tedious, time-consuming work. Your impatience usually leads to new abstractions, tools to allow Support to debug before Engineering, new lint rules to prevent common bugs, etc. </p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><strong>Put another way, you shouldn’t apply if:</strong></p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>To you, a tech lead, staff, or principal engineer is someone who spends most of their time project managing or doing architecture reviews. </em>Our most tenured engineers spend most of their time building, and we often trust them with our most challenging problems. While they lead product and technical areas and help other engineers plan their most challenging work, it’s not a requirement, nor do engineers need their sign-off.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You need company-driven process and structure to get your projects across the finish line. </em>Sprint planning and well-defined project management processes are things you need or look to others to lead. You’d rather focus on the technical details and challenges.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You only want to do exciting work. </em>We’re building a team of kind, collaborative folks. Customer issues and investigations are distributed across the team, including our high-level ICs.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You can get lost in the details.</em> Once you start implementation, it can be hard to take a step back and think about the project as a whole. You like everything to be planned upfront.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You haven’t led or taken ownership of projects before.</em> You’re used to working with tech leads and taking on tasks distributed by them.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You want to mentor earlier-career engineers.</em> We rely on engineers owning their projects, so we need engineers with that experience. This requires the team to be reasonably tenured. More than 90% of the team would be considered Senior or above in the industry today, so mentorship opportunities are very limited.</p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1>Engineering Culture</h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Our engineering culture is motivated by Benji’s (my Co-founder and CEO) and my belief that a small, talented team, given the right environment, can build high-quality software fast (and work regular hours!). We do it through:</p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Minimal process with ownership over decisions normally made by product and design</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Natural collaboration and deliberate communication</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Investing in tools and abstractions that give us leverage</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Putting effort into building a diverse team</p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h2><strong>Minimal Process &amp; Lots of Ownership</strong></h2><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">The best engineers we’ve worked with delivered reliably magical outcomes. They took customer problems and relentlessly drove them to solutions that were not only successful but often brilliant and creative. While they did this with minimal oversight, stakeholders were never in the dark as to what was going on, and no setback was a surprise.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Traditional product-development processes aren’t meant for the best engineers. Their purpose is to create consistent outcomes regardless of the engineer’s skill. But, consistency comes at the expense of an engineer’s time and freedom—both ingredients necessary to generate those magical outcomes. As a result, process stifles the best engineers and doesn’t give others the opportunity to practice the behaviors that made the best engineers the “best.”</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">At Ashby, we want to build an environment that encourages every engineer to be their best. So, at Ashby, every Engineer runs their project. Product Managers (and Designers) build strategy, do customer research, and hand off problem briefs to Engineers. Engineers take on the rest: they research the problem, write product specs, build wireframes, and implement their solution end-to-end. We rely on engineers, not process, to push information outward to the relevant folks (e.g., Product Managers) and pull folks in to help (e.g., Designers, Infra). It’s a new level of ownership for many engineers, but we’d rather an engineer fail a bit and coach up their skills than use process as a crutch. Not everyone succeeds in our culture, but those who do <em>thrive</em>.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h2><strong>Collaboration is Natural &amp; Communication is Deliberate</strong></h2><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Our engineering team consists of lifelong learners who are talented but also humble and kind (meet them <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://www.ashbyhq.com/team\"><u>here</u></a>!). These attributes create an environment where collaboration happens naturally. We combine this with research, prototyping, and written proposals to see around corners and get feedback from the team across time zones. Focus time is something that we hold sacred, and, with thoughtful and deliberate communication, engineers are in &lt;2h meetings per week (I wrote about it <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://www.ashbyhq.com/blog/company/thoughtful-communication\"><u>here</u></a>).</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">To drive it home, here's a recent calendar of an engineer who has been with us for over 4 years:</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><div style=\"text-align:left\"><img style=\"max-width:100%\" src=\"https://app.ashbyhq.com/api/images/user-content/4ea5f68e-c33e-4ac9-831a-e732bee4a303/d4679311-9dba-4031-bf5e-19ce78597ab1/calendar.png\" /></div><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We also meet in person at least twice a year, once as a department and once as a company. You also have a small budget to meet up with folks in your city/region.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h2><strong>Increase Leverage, not Team Size</strong></h2><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We built Ashby with the quality, breadth, and depth that many customers would expect from much larger teams over larger time scales. We’ve done this through investment in:</p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><strong>Great developer tooling.</strong> Our CI/CD takes ~10m, and we deploy at least 15x a day. A debugger that works out of the box. Everyone on the team has contributed to our developer experience 💪🏾.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><strong>Building blocks to create powerful and customizable products fast.</strong> At the core of Ashby is a set of common components (analytics modeling and query language, policy engine, workflow engine, design system) that we constantly improve.

            "descriptionPlain": "Hi 👋🏾 I’m Abhik https://www.linkedin.com/in/abhikpramanik, Ashby's Co-Founder and VP of Engineering. We’re looking for a versatile, persistent product engineer who’s not afraid to set up reusable building blocks across the stack and advocate for the time and space to do so. At Ashby, all our engineers ship features end-to-end at a high pace. Example is the best leadership. We’ll give you the room to do your best work, and you'll be our guide! If that speaks to you, read on.\n\nWhat Ashby gives you in return is the best of both early and growth-stage environments. The agency and no-nonsense of a seed startup: you write product specs, make product and design decisions, and build in an almost-no-meeting culture. While also the product-market fit and scale of a growth-stage startup: tens of thousands of daily users who depend on your software and eagerly await your next feature.\n\nWe have notable customers like Notion, Linear, Shopify, and Snowflake. Our growth and retention metrics are best-in-class among our peers: we have tens of millions in ARR, growing >100% year over year, very low churn, and many years of runway. We’ll share more details once we meet.\n\nYou’ve probably seen this role posted before, and it’s because we’re always expanding the team (we’re on track to double this year). We’re bubbling with ideas on how to support Talent Acquisition through software, and we’ve started the journey of building products beyond Talent Acquisition. We read every application and aim to respond to yours within 3-4 days (often sooner).\n\n\nABOUT THE ROLE AND HOW WE WORK\n\nOur engineering culture strives to recreate the environments where we did our best work as ICs – where we had the ownership and agency to impact our users with creative and innovative software.\n\nI started my career building software for artists in the Visual Effects industry. It was a formative experience for me as a software engineer because success relied on my ability to be a product manager and designer. I talked to artists to understand their needs. I came up with ideas. I did industry research, designed interfaces, and prototyped ideas. I watched artists use what I built and decided what to tackle in the next iteration. No daily stand-ups, no t-shirt sizing, no planning meetings.\n\nI studied computer science to solve problems, not tickets, and this felt exactly like that. I not only felt creative and fulfilled but the agency and ownership we were given as engineers powered an incredible amount of innovation.\n\nInnovation came differently (or not at all) at technology startups beyond the seed stage, often through an engineer’s force of will and ability to push back against culture (rather than any encouragement from it). Engineering was narrowed to implementation and delivery, partly due to the influence of other departments and partly due to the influx of \"Agile\" processes like sprint planning. In those companies, I felt like a JIRA jockey.\n\nAt Ashby, we’re building an environment that is optimistic about what engineers can own and achieve. An environment that embraces innovative engineers, and, frankly, often stays out of their way. As a Product Engineer, you’ll take ownership over a large portion of one of our products and own projects end-to-end (wearing hats traditionally worn by product and design). You’ll research competitors, write product specs, make wireframes, and more. To ground it with examples, product engineers at Ashby have:\n\n - Designed and built automated interview scheduling. This feature automates scheduling by calculating possible times from a pool of interviewers and other constraints, and then presenting these times to the candidate for selection via our responsive web app. This solves the “Calendar Tetris” problem I talk about in \"What We're Building.\"\n\n - Built a generalized declarative filter architecture that allows users to create complex filters for any record with a consistent UI and compile it to SQL in our backend. Many user-facing features use it.\n\n - Specced, designed, and implemented a feature that allows users to complete signing offers entirely within Ashby. This project involved talking to customers to understand their requirements, deciding what technologies to use, building a prototype, and working with other team members to integrate the final implementation into additional features.\n\n\nWHAT WE’RE BUILDING\n\nAs engineers, we are used to tooling that makes us better at what we do. When we started Ashby, we saw the opposite with Talent Acquisition software. Recruiting teams were leveling up how they did their work, but instead of software meeting this new standard, it held them back.\n\nScheduling a final round is an excellent example. Recruiting teams wanted to schedule candidates faster, track interviewer preparation and quality, and do it with half the headcount. A recruiter needed to manually collect availability from the candidate, identify qualified interviewers, perform “Calendar Tetris” to find who is available to interview the candidate, schedule on the earliest date possible, and make any last-minute adjustments as availability changed. They must do this while considering the interview load on each individual and whether interviewers need to be trained and shadowing others. 🥵 TA software didn’t help.\n\nAs hiring managers, we know TA is a critical function, and as engineers, we know software can do better. So, we built and continue to build Ashby to give TA teams the highest standard of tooling. Software that’s intelligent and powerful. Software that provides insights into where they’re failing and automates or simplifies many of the tasks they’re underwater with. We want other functions and departments to be jealous of what TA teams can do with Ashby, and today they often are!\n\n\nWHY YOU SHOULD OR SHOULDN’T APPLY\n\nSoftware engineers come in many flavors, not all of which fit our model. Here are some things to help you decide if this fits you and what you’re looking for:\n\n - You’re not afraid to tackle any part of a technology stack. You do what’s necessary to successfully deliver a feature, whether writing frontend or choosing new infrastructure. We’ll provide a supportive environment to do it successfully (e.g., design system, SRE team).\n\n - You’ve tackled projects with a lot of product and technical ambiguity, and you thrive at the intersection of the two. We’re not building a simple CRUD app, and many of the challenges we tackle require you to use your knowledge of our customers to build powerful abstractions and flexibility in the system to solve a class of problems.\n\n - You know how to strike the right balance between speed and quality. Ashby wasn’t built quickly. We took four years to launch publicly because convincing customers to switch required a high-quality product. However, time isn’t infinite, especially for a startup, so we still move with urgency—we’ve built the equivalent of three or more VC-backed startups with a very small team.\n\n - You are ambitious and always looking to improve your skills. For most engineers, this role will give you more freedom and responsibilities than you’ve experienced in the past. To thrive (and level up), you’ll need to be open to feedback (and we give lots of it).\n\n - You’re an excellent collaborator and communicator. Ownership and freedom don’t mean you work in a vacuum. You’ll need to vet your decisions with the appropriate stakeholders, keep them up to date when necessary, and work with other engineers to get your projects across the finish line. Clear and concise communication helps a lot here!\n\n - You seek to create leverage in your work. The nature of software is that you can often automate or abstract what would be tedious, time-consuming work. Your impatience usually leads to new abstractions, tools to allow Support to debug before Engineering, new lint rules to prevent common bugs, etc.\n\nPut another way, you shouldn’t apply if:\n\n - To you, a tech lead, staff, or principal engineer is someone who spends most of their time project managing or doing architecture reviews. Our most tenured engineers spend most of their time building, and we often trust them with our most challenging problems. While they lead product and technical areas and help other engineers plan their most challenging work, it’s not a requirement, nor do engineers need their sign-off.\n\n - You need company-driven process and structure to get your projects across the finish line. Sprint planning and well-defined project management processes are things you need or look to others to lead. You’d rather focus on the technical details and challenges.\n\n - You only want to do exciting work. We’re building a team of kind, collaborative folks. Customer issues and investigations are distributed across the team, including our high-level ICs.\n\n - You can get lost in the details. Once you start implementation, it can be hard to take a step back and think about the project as a whole. You like everything to be planned upfront.\n\n - You haven’t led or taken ownership of projects before. You’re used to working with tech leads and taking on tasks distributed by them.\n\n - You want to mentor earlier-career engineers. We rely on engineers owning their projects, so we need engineers with that experience. This requires the team to be reasonably tenured. More than 90% of the team would be considered Senior or above in the industry today, so mentorship opportunities are very limited.\n\n\nENGINEERING CULTURE\n\nOur engineering culture is motivated by Benji’s (my Co-founder and CEO) and my belief that a small, talented team, given the right environment, can build high-quality software fast (and work regular hours!). We do it through:\n\n - Minimal process with ownership over decisions normally made by product and design\n\n - Natural collaboration and deliberate communication\n\n - Investing in tools and abstractions that give us leverage\n\n - Putting effort into building a diverse team\n\n\nMINIMAL PROCESS & LOTS OF OWNERSHIP\n\nThe best engineers we’ve worked with delivered reliably magical outcomes. They took customer problems and relentlessly drove them to solutions that were not only successful but often brilliant and creative. While they did this with minimal oversight, stakeholders were never in the dark as to what was going on, and no setback was a surprise.\n\nTraditional product-development processes aren’t meant for the best engineers. Their purpose is to create consistent outcomes regardless of the engineer’s skill. But, consistency comes at the expense of an engineer’s time and freedom—both ingredients necessary to generate those magical outcomes. As a result, process stifles the best engineers and doesn’t give others the opportunity to practice the behaviors that made the best engineers the “best.”\n\nAt Ashby, we want to build an environment that encourages every engineer to be their best. So, at Ashby, every Engineer runs their project. Product Managers (and Designers) build strategy, do customer research, and hand off problem briefs to Engineers. Engineers take on the rest: they research the problem, write product specs, build wireframes, and implement their solution end-to-end. We rely on engineers, not process, to push information outward to the relevant folks (e.g., Product Managers) and pull folks in to help (e.g., Designers, Infra). It’s a new level of ownership for many engineers, but we’d rather an engineer fail a bit and coach up their skills than use process as a crutch. Not everyone succeeds in our culture, but those who do thrive.\n\n\nCOLLABORATION IS NATURAL & COMMUNICATION IS DELIBERATE\n\nOur engineering team consists of lifelong learners who are talented but also humble and kind (meet them here https://www.ashbyhq.com/team!). These attributes create an environment where collaboration happens naturally. We combine this with research, prototyping, and written proposals to see around corners and get feedback from the team across time zones. Focus time is something that we hold sacred, and, with thoughtful and deliberate communication, engineers are in <2h meetings per week (I wrote about it here https://www.ashbyhq.com/blog/company/thoughtful-communication).\n\nTo drive it home, here's a recent calendar of an engineer who has been with us for over 4 years:\n\n[https://app.ashbyhq.com/api/images/user-content/4ea5f68e-c33e-4ac9-831a-e732bee4a303/d4679311-9dba-4031-bf5e-19ce78597ab1/calendar.png]\n\nWe also meet in person at least twice a year, once as a department and once as a company. You also have a small budget to meet up with folks in your city/region.\n\n\nINCREASE LEVERAGE, NOT TEAM SIZE\n\nWe built Ashby with the quality, breadth, and depth that many customers would expect from much larger teams over larger time scales. We’ve done this through investment in:\n\n - Great developer tooling. Our CI/CD takes ~10m, and we deploy at least 15x a day. A debugger that works out of the box. Everyone on the team has contributed to our developer experience 💪🏾.\n\n - Building blocks to create powerful and customizable products fast. At the core of Ashby is a set of common components (analytics modeling and query language, policy engine, workflow engine, design system) that we constantly improve. Each improvement to a common component cascades throughout our app (short video below).\n\nHere’s an impromptu quote from Arjun in our company Slack of what it’s like to build a feature at Ashby:\n\n[https://app.ashbyhq.com/api/images/user-content/4ea5f68e-c33e-4ac9-831a-e732bee4a303/8d94727a-46d8-42a2-9627-ddcd7f822f95/arjun.png]\n\nAnd a demo of one of these building blocks:\n\n\nPUT EFFORT INTO DIVERSITY\n\nDiverse teams drive innovation and better outcomes. Having seen my mother and partner build their careers as minority women in non-diverse fields, I want to make sure Ashby creates opportunities for the next generation of engineers from underrepresented groups.\n\nToday, 21% of engineers at Ashby are from underrepresented groups. It’s not great, and we are taking conscious steps to improve, like sourcing diverse candidates, providing generous paid family leave, no leetcode interviews, and more.\n\n\nINTERVIEW PROCESS\n\nAt Ashby, our team and interview process want to help you show your best self. We’ll dive into past projects and simulate working together via pair programming, writing product and tech specs collaboratively, and talking through decisions. There are no leetcode or whiteboard exercises.\n\nOur interview process is three rounds:\n\n 1. Introduction call with Hiring Manager (15 to 30m, live)\n\n 2. A technical screen where we pair in our actual codebase (1h, live)\n\n 3. Three non-coding interviews that focus on product thinking, technical design, and infrastructure (3h 15m, live can be split across multiple days)\n\nDepending on our leadership team’s bandwidth, we may start with an additional 30m screen with a recruiter.\n\nYour hiring manager will be your main point of contact and prep you for interviews.

            "descriptionHtml": "<p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Hi 👋🏾 I’m <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/abhikpramanik\"><u>Abhik</u></a>, Ashby's Co-Founder and VP of Engineering. We’re looking for a versatile, persistent product engineer who’s not afraid to set up reusable building blocks across the stack and advocate for the time and space to do so. At Ashby, all our engineers ship features end-to-end at a high pace. Example is the best leadership. We’ll give you the room to do your best work, and you'll be our guide! If that speaks to you, read on.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">What Ashby gives you in return is the best of both early and growth-stage environments. The agency and no-nonsense of a seed startup: you write product specs, make product and design decisions, and build in an almost-no-meeting culture. While also the product-market fit and scale of a growth-stage startup: tens of thousands of daily users who depend on your software and eagerly await your next feature.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We have notable customers like Notion, Linear, Shopify, and Snowflake. Our growth and retention metrics are best-in-class among our peers: we have tens of millions in ARR, growing &gt;100% year over year, very low churn, and many years of runway. We’ll share more details once we meet.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You’ve probably seen this role posted before, and it’s because we’re always expanding the team (we’re on track to double this year). We’re bubbling with ideas on how to support Talent Acquisition through software, and we’ve started the journey of building products beyond Talent Acquisition. We read every application and aim to respond to yours within 3-4 days (often sooner).</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1>About the Role and How We Work</h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Our engineering culture strives to recreate the environments where we did our best work as ICs – where we had the ownership and agency to impact our users with creative and innovative software.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">I started my career building software for artists in the Visual Effects industry. It was a formative experience for me as a software engineer because success relied on my ability to be a product manager and designer. I talked to artists to understand their needs. I came up with ideas. I did industry research, designed interfaces, and prototyped ideas. I watched artists use what I built and decided what to tackle in the next iteration. No daily stand-ups, no t-shirt sizing, no planning meetings.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">I studied computer science to solve problems, not tickets, and this felt exactly like that. I not only felt creative and fulfilled but the agency and ownership we were given as engineers powered an incredible amount of innovation.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Innovation came differently (or not at all) at technology startups beyond the seed stage, often through an engineer’s force of will and ability to push back against culture (rather than any encouragement from it). Engineering was narrowed to implementation and delivery, partly due to the influence of other departments and partly due to the influx of \"Agile\" processes like sprint planning. In those companies, I felt like a JIRA jockey. </p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">At Ashby, we’re building an environment that is optimistic about what engineers can own and achieve. An environment that embraces innovative engineers, and, frankly, often stays out of their way. As a Product Engineer, you’ll take ownership over a large portion of one of our products and own projects end-to-end (wearing hats traditionally worn by product and design). You’ll research competitors, write product specs, make wireframes, and more. To ground it with examples, product engineers at Ashby have:</p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Designed and built automated interview scheduling. This feature automates scheduling by calculating possible times from a pool of interviewers and other constraints, and then presenting these times to the candidate for selection via our responsive web app. This solves the “Calendar Tetris” problem I talk about in \"What We're Building.\"</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Built a generalized declarative filter architecture that allows users to create complex filters for any record with a consistent UI and compile it to SQL in our backend. Many user-facing features use it.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Specced, designed, and implemented a feature that allows users to complete signing offers entirely within Ashby. This project involved talking to customers to understand their requirements, deciding what technologies to use, building a prototype, and working with other team members to integrate the final implementation into additional features.</p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1>What We’re Building</h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">As engineers, we are used to tooling that makes us <strong>better</strong> at what we do. When we started Ashby, we saw the opposite with Talent Acquisition software. Recruiting teams were leveling up how they did their work, but instead of software meeting this new standard, it held them back.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Scheduling a final round is an excellent example. Recruiting teams wanted to schedule candidates faster, track interviewer preparation and quality, and do it with half the headcount. A recruiter needed to manually collect availability from the candidate, identify qualified interviewers, perform “Calendar Tetris” to find who is available to interview the candidate, schedule on the earliest date possible, and make any last-minute adjustments as availability changed. They must do this while considering the interview load on each individual and whether interviewers need to be trained and shadowing others. 🥵 TA software didn’t help.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">As hiring managers, we know TA is a critical function, and as engineers, we know software can do better. So, we built and continue to build Ashby to give TA teams the <em>highest</em> standard of tooling. Software that’s intelligent and powerful. Software that provides insights into where they’re failing and automates or simplifies many of the tasks they’re underwater with. We want other functions and departments to be jealous of what TA teams can do with Ashby, and today they often are!</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1>Why You Should or Shouldn’t Apply</h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Software engineers come in many flavors, not all of which fit our model. Here are some things  to help you decide if this fits you and what you’re looking for:</p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You’re not afraid to tackle any part of a technology stack.</em> You do what’s necessary to successfully deliver a feature, whether writing frontend or choosing new infrastructure. We’ll provide a supportive environment to do it successfully (e.g., design system, SRE team).</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You’ve tackled projects with a lot of product and technical ambiguity, and you thrive at the intersection of the two. </em>We’re not building a simple CRUD app, and many of the challenges we tackle require you to use your knowledge of our customers to build powerful abstractions and flexibility in the system to solve a class of problems.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You know how to strike the right balance between speed and quality. </em>Ashby wasn’t built quickly. We took four years to launch publicly because convincing customers to switch required a high-quality product. However, time isn’t infinite, especially for a startup, so we still move with urgency—we’ve built the equivalent of three or more VC-backed startups with a very small team.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You are ambitious and always looking to improve your skills. </em>For most engineers, this role will give you more freedom and responsibilities than you’ve experienced in the past. To thrive (and level up), you’ll need to be open to feedback (and we give lots of it).</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You’re an excellent collaborator and communicator. </em>Ownership and freedom don’t mean you work in a vacuum. You’ll need to vet your decisions with the appropriate stakeholders, keep them up to date when necessary, and work with other engineers to get your projects across the finish line. Clear and concise communication helps a lot here!</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You seek to create leverage in your work. </em>The nature of software is that you can often automate or abstract what would be tedious, time-consuming work. Your impatience usually leads to new abstractions, tools to allow Support to debug before Engineering, new lint rules to prevent common bugs, etc. </p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><strong>Put another way, you shouldn’t apply if:</strong></p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>To you, a tech lead, staff, or principal engineer is someone who spends most of their time project managing or doing architecture reviews. </em>Our most tenured engineers spend most of their time building, and we often trust them with our most challenging problems. While they lead product and technical areas and help other engineers plan their most challenging work, it’s not a requirement, nor do engineers need their sign-off.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You need company-driven process and structure to get your projects across the finish line. </em>Sprint planning and well-defined project management processes are things you need or look to others to lead. You’d rather focus on the technical details and challenges.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You only want to do exciting work. </em>We’re building a team of kind, collaborative folks. Customer issues and investigations are distributed across the team, including our high-level ICs.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You can get lost in the details.</em> Once you start implementation, it can be hard to take a step back and think about the project as a whole. You like everything to be planned upfront.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You haven’t led or taken ownership of projects before.</em> You’re used to working with tech leads and taking on tasks distributed by them.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You want to mentor earlier-career engineers.</em> We rely on engineers owning their projects, so we need engineers with that experience. This requires the team to be reasonably tenured. More than 90% of the team would be considered Senior or above in the industry today, so mentorship opportunities are very limited.</p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1>Engineering Culture</h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Our engineering culture is motivated by Benji’s (my Co-founder and CEO) and my belief that a small, talented team, given the right environment, can build high-quality software fast (and work regular hours!). We do it through:</p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Minimal process with ownership over decisions normally made by product and design</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Natural collaboration and deliberate communication</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Investing in tools and abstractions that give us leverage</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Putting effort into building a diverse team</p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h2><strong>Minimal Process &amp; Lots of Ownership</strong></h2><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">The best engineers we’ve worked with delivered reliably magical outcomes. They took customer problems and relentlessly drove them to solutions that were not only successful but often brilliant and creative. While they did this with minimal oversight, stakeholders were never in the dark as to what was going on, and no setback was a surprise.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Traditional product-development processes aren’t meant for the best engineers. Their purpose is to create consistent outcomes regardless of the engineer’s skill. But, consistency comes at the expense of an engineer’s time and freedom—both ingredients necessary to generate those magical outcomes. As a result, process stifles the best engineers and doesn’t give others the opportunity to practice the behaviors that made the best engineers the “best.”</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">At Ashby, we want to build an environment that encourages every engineer to be their best. So, at Ashby, every Engineer runs their project. Product Managers (and Designers) build strategy, do customer research, and hand off problem briefs to Engineers. Engineers take on the rest: they research the problem, write product specs, build wireframes, and implement their solution end-to-end. We rely on engineers, not process, to push information outward to the relevant folks (e.g., Product Managers) and pull folks in to help (e.g., Designers, Infra). It’s a new level of ownership for many engineers, but we’d rather an engineer fail a bit and coach up their skills than use process as a crutch. Not everyone succeeds in our culture, but those who do <em>thrive</em>.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h2><strong>Collaboration is Natural &amp; Communication is Deliberate</strong></h2><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Our engineering team consists of lifelong learners who are talented but also humble and kind (meet them <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://www.ashbyhq.com/team\"><u>here</u></a>!). These attributes create an environment where collaboration happens naturally. We combine this with research, prototyping, and written proposals to see around corners and get feedback from the team across time zones.

            "descriptionPlain": "Hi 👋🏾 I’m Abhik https://www.linkedin.com/in/abhikpramanik, Ashby's Co-Founder and VP of Engineering. We’re looking for a versatile, persistent product engineer who’s not afraid to set up reusable building blocks across the stack and advocate for the time and space to do so. At Ashby, all our engineers ship features end-to-end at a high pace. Example is the best leadership. We’ll give you the room to do your best work, and you'll be our guide! If that speaks to you, read on.\n\nWhat Ashby gives you in return is the best of both early and growth-stage environments. The agency and no-nonsense of a seed startup: you write product specs, make product and design decisions, and build in an almost-no-meeting culture. While also the product-market fit and scale of a growth-stage startup: tens of thousands of daily users who depend on your software and eagerly await your next feature.\n\nWe have notable customers like Notion, Linear, Shopify, and Snowflake. Our growth and retention metrics are best-in-class among our peers: we have tens of millions in ARR, growing >100% year over year, very low churn, and many years of runway. We’ll share more details once we meet.\n\nYou’ve probably seen this role posted before, and it’s because we’re always expanding the team (we’re on track to double this year). We’re bubbling with ideas on how to support Talent Acquisition through software, and we’ve started the journey of building products beyond Talent Acquisition. We read every application and aim to respond to yours within 3-4 days (often sooner).\n\n\nABOUT THE ROLE AND HOW WE WORK\n\nOur engineering culture strives to recreate the environments where we did our best work as ICs – where we had the ownership and agency to impact our users with creative and innovative software.\n\nI started my career building software for artists in the Visual Effects industry. It was a formative experience for me as a software engineer because success relied on my ability to be a product manager and designer. I talked to artists to understand their needs. I came up with ideas. I did industry research, designed interfaces, and prototyped ideas. I watched artists use what I built and decided what to tackle in the next iteration. No daily stand-ups, no t-shirt sizing, no planning meetings.\n\nI studied computer science to solve problems, not tickets, and this felt exactly like that. I not only felt creative and fulfilled but the agency and ownership we were given as engineers powered an incredible amount of innovation.\n\nInnovation came differently (or not at all) at technology startups beyond the seed stage, often through an engineer’s force of will and ability to push back against culture (rather than any encouragement from it). Engineering was narrowed to implementation and delivery, partly due to the influence of other departments and partly due to the influx of \"Agile\" processes like sprint planning. In those companies, I felt like a JIRA jockey.\n\nAt Ashby, we’re building an environment that is optimistic about what engineers can own and achieve. An environment that embraces innovative engineers, and, frankly, often stays out of their way. As a Product Engineer, you’ll take ownership over a large portion of one of our products and own projects end-to-end (wearing hats traditionally worn by product and design). You’ll research competitors, write product specs, make wireframes, and more. To ground it with examples, product engineers at Ashby have:\n\n - Designed and built automated interview scheduling. This feature automates scheduling by calculating possible times from a pool of interviewers and other constraints, and then presenting these times to the candidate for selection via our responsive web app. This solves the “Calendar Tetris” problem I talk about in \"What We're Building.\"\n\n - Built a generalized declarative filter architecture that allows users to create complex filters for any record with a consistent UI and compile it to SQL in our backend. Many user-facing features use it.\n\n - Specced, designed, and implemented a feature that allows users to complete signing offers entirely within Ashby. This project involved talking to customers to understand their requirements, deciding what technologies to use, building a prototype, and working with other team members to integrate the final implementation into additional features.\n\n\nWHAT WE’RE BUILDING\n\nAs engineers, we are used to tooling that makes us better at what we do. When we started Ashby, we saw the opposite with Talent Acquisition software. Recruiting teams were leveling up how they did their work, but instead of software meeting this new standard, it held them back.\n\nScheduling a final round is an excellent example. Recruiting teams wanted to schedule candidates faster, track interviewer preparation and quality, and do it with half the headcount. A recruiter needed to manually collect availability from the candidate, identify qualified interviewers, perform “Calendar Tetris” to find who is available to interview the candidate, schedule on the earliest date possible, and make any last-minute adjustments as availability changed. They must do this while considering the interview load on each individual and whether interviewers need to be trained and shadowing others. 🥵 TA software didn’t help.\n\nAs hiring managers, we know TA is a critical function, and as engineers, we know software can do better. So, we built and continue to build Ashby to give TA teams the highest standard of tooling. Software that’s intelligent and powerful. Software that provides insights into where they’re failing and automates or simplifies many of the tasks they’re underwater with. We want other functions and departments to be jealous of what TA teams can do with Ashby, and today they often are!\n\n\nWHY YOU SHOULD OR SHOULDN’T APPLY\n\nSoftware engineers come in many flavors, not all of which fit our model. Here are some things to help you decide if this fits you and what you’re looking for:\n\n - You’re not afraid to tackle any part of a technology stack. You do what’s necessary to successfully deliver a feature, whether writing frontend or choosing new infrastructure. We’ll provide a supportive environment to do it successfully (e.g., design system, SRE team).\n\n - You’ve tackled projects with a lot of product and technical ambiguity, and you thrive at the intersection of the two. We’re not building a simple CRUD app, and many of the challenges we tackle require you to use your knowledge of our customers to build powerful abstractions and flexibility in the system to solve a class of problems.\n\n - You know how to strike the right balance between speed and quality. Ashby wasn’t built quickly. We took four years to launch publicly because convincing customers to switch required a high-quality product. However, time isn’t infinite, especially for a startup, so we still move with urgency—we’ve built the equivalent of three or more VC-backed startups with a very small team.\n\n - You are ambitious and always looking to improve your skills. For most engineers, this role will give you more freedom and responsibilities than you’ve experienced in the past. To thrive (and level up), you’ll need to be open to feedback (and we give lots of it).\n\n - You’re an excellent collaborator and communicator. Ownership and freedom don’t mean you work in a vacuum. You’ll need to vet your decisions with the appropriate stakeholders, keep them up to date when necessary, and work with other engineers to get your projects across the finish line. Clear and concise communication helps a lot here!\n\n - You seek to create leverage in your work. The nature of software is that you can often automate or abstract what would be tedious, time-consuming work. Your impatience usually leads to new abstractions, tools to allow Support to debug before Engineering, new lint rules to prevent common bugs, etc.\n\nPut another way, you shouldn’t apply if:\n\n - To you, a tech lead, staff, or principal engineer is someone who spends most of their time project managing or doing architecture reviews. Our most tenured engineers spend most of their time building, and we often trust them with our most challenging problems. While they lead product and technical areas and help other engineers plan their most challenging work, it’s not a requirement, nor do engineers need their sign-off.\n\n - You need company-driven process and structure to get your projects across the finish line. Sprint planning and well-defined project management processes are things you need or look to others to lead. You’d rather focus on the technical details and challenges.\n\n - You only want to do exciting work. We’re building a team of kind, collaborative folks. Customer issues and investigations are distributed across the team, including our high-level ICs.\n\n - You can get lost in the details. Once you start implementation, it can be hard to take a step back and think about the project as a whole. You like everything to be planned upfront.\n\n - You haven’t led or taken ownership of projects before. You’re used to working with tech leads and taking on tasks distributed by them.\n\n - You want to mentor earlier-career engineers. We rely on engineers owning their projects, so we need engineers with that experience. This requires the team to be reasonably tenured. More than 90% of the team would be considered Senior or above in the industry today, so mentorship opportunities are very limited.\n\n\nENGINEERING CULTURE\n\nOur engineering culture is motivated by Benji’s (my Co-founder and CEO) and my belief that a small, talented team, given the right environment, can build high-quality software fast (and work regular hours!). We do it through:\n\n - Minimal process with ownership over decisions normally made by product and design\n\n - Natural collaboration and deliberate communication\n\n - Investing in tools and abstractions that give us leverage\n\n - Putting effort into building a diverse team\n\n\nMINIMAL PROCESS & LOTS OF OWNERSHIP\n\nThe best engineers we’ve worked with delivered reliably magical outcomes. They took customer problems and relentlessly drove them to solutions that were not only successful but often brilliant and creative. While they did this with minimal oversight, stakeholders were never in the dark as to what was going on, and no setback was a surprise.\n\nTraditional product-development processes aren’t meant for the best engineers.

Not everyone succeeds in our culture, but those who do thrive.\n\n\nCOLLABORATION IS NATURAL & COMMUNICATION IS DELIBERATE\n\nOur engineering team consists of lifelong learners who are talented but also humble and kind (meet them here https://www.ashbyhq.com/team!). These attributes create an environment where collaboration happens naturally. We combine this with research, prototyping, and written proposals to see around corners and get feedback from the team across time zones.

We’re looking for a versatile, persistent product engineer who’s not afraid to set up reusable building blocks across the stack and advocate for the time and space to do so. At Ashby, all our engineers ship features end-to-end at a high pace. Example is the best leadership. We’ll give you the room to do your best work, and you'll be our guide! If that speaks to you, read on.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">What Ashby gives you in return is the best of both early and growth-stage environments. The agency and no-nonsense of a seed startup: you write product specs, make product and design decisions, and build in an almost-no-meeting culture. While also the product-market fit and scale of a growth-stage startup: tens of thousands of daily users who depend on your software and eagerly await your next feature.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We have notable customers like Notion, Linear, Shopify, and Snowflake. Our growth and retention metrics are best-in-class among our peers: we have tens of millions in ARR, growing &gt;100% year over year, very low churn, and many years of runway. We’ll share more details once we meet.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You’ve probably seen this role posted before, and it’s because we’re always expanding the team (we’re on track to double this year). We’re bubbling with ideas on how to support Talent Acquisition through software, and we’ve started the journey of building products beyond Talent Acquisition. We read every application and aim to respond to yours within 3-4 days (often sooner).</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1>About the Role and How We Work</h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Our engineering culture strives to recreate the environments where we did our best work as ICs – where we had the ownership and agency to impact our users with creative and innovative software.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">I started my career building software for artists in the Visual Effects industry. It was a formative experience for me as a software engineer because success relied on my ability to be a product manager and designer. I talked to artists to understand their needs. I came up with ideas. I did industry research, designed interfaces, and prototyped ideas. I watched artists use what I built and decided what to tackle in the next iteration. No daily stand-ups, no t-shirt sizing, no planning meetings.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">I studied computer science to solve problems, not tickets, and this felt exactly like that. I not only felt creative and fulfilled but the agency and ownership we were given as engineers powered an incredible amount of innovation.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Innovation came differently (or not at all) at technology startups beyond the seed stage, often through an engineer’s force of will and ability to push back against culture (rather than any encouragement from it). Engineering was narrowed to implementation and delivery, partly due to the influence of other departments and partly due to the influx of \"Agile\" processes like sprint planning. In those companies, I felt like a JIRA jockey. </p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">At Ashby, we’re building an environment that is optimistic about what engineers can own and achieve. An environment that embraces innovative engineers, and, frankly, often stays out of their way. As a Product Engineer, you’ll take ownership over a large portion of one of our products and own projects end-to-end (wearing hats traditionally worn by product and design). You’ll research competitors, write product specs, make wireframes, and more. To ground it with examples, product engineers at Ashby have:</p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Designed and built automated interview scheduling. This feature automates scheduling by calculating possible times from a pool of interviewers and other constraints, and then presenting these times to the candidate for selection via our responsive web app. This solves the “Calendar Tetris” problem I talk about in \"What We're Building.\"</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Built a generalized declarative filter architecture that allows users to create complex filters for any record with a consistent UI and compile it to SQL in our backend. Many user-facing features use it.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Specced, designed, and implemented a feature that allows users to complete signing offers entirely within Ashby. This project involved talking to customers to understand their requirements, deciding what technologies to use, building a prototype, and working with other team members to integrate the final implementation into additional features.</p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1>What We’re Building</h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">As engineers, we are used to tooling that makes us <strong>better</strong> at what we do. When we started Ashby, we saw the opposite with Talent Acquisition software. Recruiting teams were leveling up how they did their work, but instead of software meeting this new standard, it held them back.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Scheduling a final round is an excellent example. Recruiting teams wanted to schedule candidates faster, track interviewer preparation and quality, and do it with half the headcount. A recruiter needed to manually collect availability from the candidate, identify qualified interviewers, perform “Calendar Tetris” to find who is available to interview the candidate, schedule on the earliest date possible, and make any last-minute adjustments as availability changed. They must do this while considering the interview load on each individual and whether interviewers need to be trained and shadowing others. 🥵 TA software didn’t help.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">As hiring managers, we know TA is a critical function, and as engineers, we know software can do better. So, we built and continue to build Ashby to give TA teams the <em>highest</em> standard of tooling. Software that’s intelligent and powerful. Software that provides insights into where they’re failing and automates or simplifies many of the tasks they’re underwater with. We want other functions and departments to be jealous of what TA teams can do with Ashby, and today they often are!</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1>Why You Should or Shouldn’t Apply</h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Software engineers come in many flavors, not all of which fit our model. Here are some things  to help you decide if this fits you and what you’re looking for:</p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You’re not afraid to tackle any part of a technology stack.</em> You do what’s necessary to successfully deliver a feature, whether writing frontend or choosing new infrastructure. We’ll provide a supportive environment to do it successfully (e.g., design system, SRE team).</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You’ve tackled projects with a lot of product and technical ambiguity, and you thrive at the intersection of the two. </em>We’re not building a simple CRUD app, and many of the challenges we tackle require you to use your knowledge of our customers to build powerful abstractions and flexibility in the system to solve a class of problems.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You know how to strike the right balance between speed and quality. </em>Ashby wasn’t built quickly. We took four years to launch publicly because convincing customers to switch required a high-quality product. However, time isn’t infinite, especially for a startup, so we still move with urgency—we’ve built the equivalent of three or more VC-backed startups with a very small team.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You are ambitious and always looking to improve your skills. </em>For most engineers, this role will give you more freedom and responsibilities than you’ve experienced in the past. To thrive (and level up), you’ll need to be open to feedback (and we give lots of it).</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You’re an excellent collaborator and communicator. </em>Ownership and freedom don’t mean you work in a vacuum. You’ll need to vet your decisions with the appropriate stakeholders, keep them up to date when necessary, and work with other engineers to get your projects across the finish line. Clear and concise communication helps a lot here!</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You seek to create leverage in your work. </em>The nature of software is that you can often automate or abstract what would be tedious, time-consuming work. Your impatience usually leads to new abstractions, tools to allow Support to debug before Engineering, new lint rules to prevent common bugs, etc. </p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><strong>Put another way, you shouldn’t apply if:</strong></p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>To you, a tech lead, staff, or principal engineer is someone who spends most of their time project managing or doing architecture reviews. </em>Our most tenured engineers spend most of their time building, and we often trust them with our most challenging problems. While they lead product and technical areas and help other engineers plan their most challenging work, it’s not a requirement, nor do engineers need their sign-off.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You need company-driven process and structure to get your projects across the finish line. </em>Sprint planning and well-defined project management processes are things you need or look to others to lead. You’d rather focus on the technical details and challenges.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You only want to do exciting work. </em>We’re building a team of kind, collaborative folks. Customer issues and investigations are distributed across the team, including our high-level ICs.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You can get lost in the details.</em> Once you start implementation, it can be hard to take a step back and think about the project as a whole. You like everything to be planned upfront.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You haven’t led or taken ownership of projects before.</em> You’re used to working with tech leads and taking on tasks distributed by them.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You want to mentor earlier-career engineers.</em> We rely on engineers owning their projects, so we need engineers with that experience. This requires the team to be reasonably tenured. More than 90% of the team would be considered Senior or above in the industry today, so mentorship opportunities are very limited.</p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1>Engineering Culture</h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Our engineering culture is motivated by Benji’s (my Co-founder and CEO) and my belief that a small, talented team, given the right environment, can build high-quality software fast (and work regular hours!). We do it through:</p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Minimal process with ownership over decisions normally made by product and design</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Natural collaboration and deliberate communication</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Investing in tools and abstractions that give us leverage</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Putting effort into building a diverse team</p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h2><strong>Minimal Process &amp; Lots of Ownership</strong></h2><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">The best engineers we’ve worked with delivered reliably magical outcomes. They took customer problems and relentlessly drove them to solutions that were not only successful but often brilliant and creative. While they did this with minimal oversight, stakeholders were never in the dark as to what was going on, and no setback was a surprise.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Traditional product-development processes aren’t meant for the best engineers. Their purpose is to create consistent outcomes regardless of the engineer’s skill. But, consistency comes at the expense of an engineer’s time and freedom—both ingredients necessary to generate those magical outcomes. As a result, process stifles the best engineers and doesn’t give others the opportunity to practice the behaviors that made the best engineers the “best.”</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">At Ashby, we want to build an environment that encourages every engineer to be their best. So, at Ashby, every Engineer runs their project. Product Managers (and Designers) build strategy, do customer research, and hand off problem briefs to Engineers. Engineers take on the rest: they research the problem, write product specs, build wireframes, and implement their solution end-to-end. We rely on engineers, not process, to push information outward to the relevant folks (e.g., Product Managers) and pull folks in to help (e.g., Designers, Infra). It’s a new level of ownership for many engineers, but we’d rather an engineer fail a bit and coach up their skills than use process as a crutch. Not everyone succeeds in our culture, but those who do <em>thrive</em>.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h2><strong>Collaboration is Natural &amp; Communication is Deliberate</strong></h2><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Our engineering team consists of lifelong learners who are talented but also humble and kind (meet them <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://www.ashbyhq.com/team\"><u>here</u></a>!). These attributes create an environment where collaboration happens naturally. We combine this with research, prototyping, and written proposals to see around corners and get feedback from the team across time zones. Focus time is something that we hold sacred, and, with thoughtful and deliberate communication, engineers are in &lt;2h meetings per week (I wrote about it <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://www.ashbyhq.com/blog/company/thoughtful-communication\"><u>here</u></a>).</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">To drive it home, here's a recent calendar of an engineer who has been with us for over 4 years:</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><div style=\"text-align:left\"><img style=\"max-width:100%\" src=\"https://app.ashbyhq.com/api/images/user-content/4ea5f68e-c33e-4ac9-831a-e732bee4a303/d4679311-9dba-4031-bf5e-19ce78597ab1/calendar.png\" /></div><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We also meet in person at least twice a year, once as a department and once as a company. You also have a small budget to meet up with folks in your city/region.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h2><strong>Increase Leverage, not Team Size</strong></h2><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We built Ashby with the quality, breadth, and depth that many customers would expect from much larger teams over larger time scales. We’ve done this through investment in:</p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><strong>Great developer tooling.</strong> Our CI/CD takes ~10m, and we deploy at least 15x a day. A debugger that works out of the box. Everyone on the team has contributed to our developer experience 💪🏾.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><strong>Building blocks to create powerful and customizable products fast.</strong> At the core of Ashby is a set of common components (analytics modeling and query language, policy engine, workflow engine, design system) that we constantly improve. Each improvement to a common component cascades throughout our app (short video below).</p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Here’s an impromptu quote from Arjun in our company Slack of what it’s like to build a feature at Ashby:</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><div style=\"text-align:left\"><img style=\"max-width:100%\" src=\"https://app.ashbyhq.com/api/images/user-content/4ea5f68e-c33e-4ac9-831a-e732bee4a303/8d94727a-46d8-42a2-9627-ddcd7f822f95/arjun.png\" /></div><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">And a demo of one of these building blocks:</p><div><div style=\"left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:62.5%\"><iframe src=\"https://embedded-media.ashbyhq.com/embed/4ea5f68e-c33e-4ac9-831a-e732bee4a303/9a5f032d-c731-411e-98cf-261517156f01\" style=\"top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0\" allowfullscreen scrolling=\"no\" allow=\"encrypted-media *; picture-in-picture *;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-presentation\"></iframe></div></div><h2><strong>Put Effort into Diversity</strong></h2><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Diverse teams drive innovation and better outcomes. Having seen my mother and partner build their careers as minority women in non-diverse fields, I want to make sure Ashby creates opportunities for the next generation of engineers from underrepresented groups.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Today, 21% of engineers at Ashby are from underrepresented groups. It’s not great, and we are taking conscious steps to improve, like sourcing diverse candidates, providing generous paid family leave, no leetcode interviews, and more.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1><strong>Interview Process</strong></h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">At Ashby, our team and interview process want to help you show your best self. We’ll dive into past projects and simulate working together via pair programming, writing product and tech specs collaboratively, and talking through decisions. There are no leetcode or whiteboard exercises.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Our interview process is three rounds:</p><ol style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Introduction call with Hiring Manager (15 to 30m, live)</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">A technical screen where we pair in our actual codebase (1h, live)</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Three non-coding interviews that focus on product thinking, technical design, and infrastructure (3h 15m, live can be split across multiple days)</p></li></ol><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Depending on our leadership team’s bandwidth, we may start with an <em>additional</em> 30m screen with a recruiter.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Your hiring manager will be your main point of contact and prep you for interviews. Each round will have written guidance so you know what to expect (you’ll need minimal preparation). You’ll meet 4 to 6 people in engineering (with 5-15 minutes in each interview to ask them questions). If we don’t give an offer, we’ll provide feedback!</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1><strong>Your First Three Months at Ashby</strong></h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We want an exceptional onboarding experience for every new hire. At Ashby, your dev environment is set up with a single script, you push your first product change on day one, and you spend the rest of your time shipping product changes that give you a tour of our codebase and best practices. The product changes increase in scope and ambiguity from simple copy changes to the delivery of a prominent, impactful feature. Your manager will do a 30, 60, and 90-day review to give feedback and calibrate on how we work together.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">It’s a team effort to get you successfully onboarded; you’ll have a peer paired with you to answer questions, pair program, and check in often to see if you need help. The rest of the team will run training sessions on our culture, product, engineering process, and technical architecture.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1><strong>Technology Stack</strong></h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">I’m sharing our tech stack with the caveat that we don’t require previous experience in it (but a love of typed languages is helpful 😀): TypeScript (frontend &amp; backend), React, GraphQL API, Node.js, Postgres, Redis.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">When they joined Ashby, many of our engineers switched from other languages like Swift and Kotlin (<a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://linkedin.com/in/benasher44/\"><u>Ben</u></a>), platforms like iOS (<a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/tom-quist-0925a199/\"><u>Tom</u></a>) and Windows (<a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/sergeygalich/\"><u>Sergey</u></a>). We care more about fundamentals (e.g., debugging, abstractions) and how fast you learn. For folks on the team who switched, it's nice seeing changes hot reload versus waiting for XCode to compile 😅.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1><strong>Benefits</strong></h1><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Competitive salary and equity.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">10-year exercise window for stock options. You shouldn’t feel pressure to purchase stock options if you leave Ashby —do it when you feel financially comfortable.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Unlimited PTO, and we will encourage you to take it.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">A minimum of 12 weeks of fully paid parental leave, covered by Ashby. For folks outside the US, it may be longer to be in line with regional requirements.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Generous equipment, software, and office furniture budget. Get what you need to be happy and productive!</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">$100/month education budget with more expensive items (like conferences) covered with manager approval.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">If you’re in the US, we offer top-tier health insurance for you and your dependents, with 100% of premiums covered by Ashby. In other countries, we provide high-quality supplemental health insurance for you and your dependents, also fully covered by us.</p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Ashby’s success hinges on hiring great people and creating an environment where we can be happy, feel challenged, and do our best work. We’re being deliberate about building that environment from the ground up. I hope that excites you enough to apply.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>Ashby provides equal employment opportunities (EEO) to all employees and applicants for employment without regard to race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability, genetics, sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression.

The nature of software is that you can often automate or abstract what would be tedious, time-consuming work. Your impatience usually leads to new abstractions, tools to allow Support to debug before Engineering, new lint rules to prevent common bugs, etc.\n\nPut another way, you shouldn’t apply if:\n\n - To you, a tech lead, staff, or principal engineer is someone who spends most of their time project managing or doing architecture reviews. Our most tenured engineers spend most of their time building, and we often trust them with our most challenging problems. While they lead product and technical areas and help other engineers plan their most challenging work, it’s not a requirement, nor do engineers need their sign-off.\n\n - You need company-driven process and structure to get your projects across the finish line. Sprint planning and well-defined project management processes are things you need or look to others to lead. You’d rather focus on the technical details and challenges.\n\n - You only want to do exciting work. We’re building a team of kind, collaborative folks. Customer issues and investigations are distributed across the team, including our high-level ICs.\n\n - You can get lost in the details. Once you start implementation, it can be hard to take a step back and think about the project as a whole. You like everything to be planned upfront.\n\n - You haven’t led or taken ownership of projects before. You’re used to working with tech leads and taking on tasks distributed by them.\n\n - You want to mentor earlier-career engineers. We rely on engineers owning their projects, so we need engineers with that experience. This requires the team to be reasonably tenured. More than 90% of the team would be considered Senior or above in the industry today, so mentorship opportunities are very limited.\n\n\nENGINEERING CULTURE\n\nOur engineering culture is motivated by Benji’s (my Co-founder and CEO) and my belief that a small, talented team, given the right environment, can build high-quality software fast (and work regular hours!). We do it through:\n\n - Minimal process with ownership over decisions normally made by product and design\n\n - Natural collaboration and deliberate communication\n\n - Investing in tools and abstractions that give us leverage\n\n - Putting effort into building a diverse team\n\n\nMINIMAL PROCESS & LOTS OF OWNERSHIP\n\nThe best engineers we’ve worked with delivered reliably magical outcomes. They took customer problems and relentlessly drove them to solutions that were not only successful but often brilliant and creative. While they did this with minimal oversight, stakeholders were never in the dark as to what was going on, and no setback was a surprise.\n\nTraditional product-development processes aren’t meant for the best engineers. Their purpose is to create consistent outcomes regardless of the engineer’s skill. But, consistency comes at the expense of an engineer’s time and freedom—both ingredients necessary to generate those magical outcomes. As a result, process stifles the best engineers and doesn’t give others the opportunity to practice the behaviors that made the best engineers the “best.”\n\nAt Ashby, we want to build an environment that encourages every engineer to be their best. So, at Ashby, every Engineer runs their project. Product Managers (and Designers) build strategy, do customer research, and hand off problem briefs to Engineers. Engineers take on the rest: they research the problem, write product specs, build wireframes, and implement their solution end-to-end. We rely on engineers, not process, to push information outward to the relevant folks (e.g., Product Managers) and pull folks in to help (e.g., Designers, Infra). It’s a new level of ownership for many engineers, but we’d rather an engineer fail a bit and coach up their skills than use process as a crutch. Not everyone succeeds in our culture, but those who do thrive.\n\n\nCOLLABORATION IS NATURAL & COMMUNICATION IS DELIBERATE\n\nOur engineering team consists of lifelong learners who are talented but also humble and kind (meet them here https://www.ashbyhq.com/team!). These attributes create an environment where collaboration happens naturally. We combine this with research, prototyping, and written proposals to see around corners and get feedback from the team across time zones. Focus time is something that we hold sacred, and, with thoughtful and deliberate communication, engineers are in <2h meetings per week (I wrote about it here https://www.ashbyhq.com/blog/company/thoughtful-communication).\n\nTo drive it home, here's a recent calendar of an engineer who has been with us for over 4 years:\n\n[https://app.ashbyhq.com/api/images/user-content/4ea5f68e-c33e-4ac9-831a-e732bee4a303/d4679311-9dba-4031-bf5e-19ce78597ab1/calendar.png]\n\nWe also meet in person at least twice a year, once as a department and once as a company. You also have a small budget to meet up with folks in your city/region.\n\n\nINCREASE LEVERAGE, NOT TEAM SIZE\n\nWe built Ashby with the quality, breadth, and depth that many customers would expect from much larger teams over larger time scales. We’ve done this through investment in:\n\n - Great developer tooling. Our CI/CD takes ~10m, and we deploy at least 15x a day. A debugger that works out of the box. Everyone on the team has contributed to our developer experience 💪🏾.\n\n - Building blocks to create powerful and customizable products fast. At the core of Ashby is a set of common components (analytics modeling and query language, policy engine, workflow engine, design system) that we constantly improve. Each improvement to a common component cascades throughout our app (short video below).\n\nHere’s an impromptu quote from Arjun in our company Slack of what it’s like to build a feature at Ashby:\n\n[https://app.ashbyhq.com/api/images/user-content/4ea5f68e-c33e-4ac9-831a-e732bee4a303/8d94727a-46d8-42a2-9627-ddcd7f822f95/arjun.png]\n\nAnd a demo of one of these building blocks:\n\n\nPUT EFFORT INTO DIVERSITY\n\nDiverse teams drive innovation and better outcomes. Having seen my mother and partner build their careers as minority women in non-diverse fields, I want to make sure Ashby creates opportunities for the next generation of engineers from underrepresented groups.\n\nToday, 21% of engineers at Ashby are from underrepresented groups. It’s not great, and we are taking conscious steps to improve, like sourcing diverse candidates, providing generous paid family leave, no leetcode interviews, and more.\n\n\nINTERVIEW PROCESS\n\nAt Ashby, our team and interview process want to help you show your best self. We’ll dive into past projects and simulate working together via pair programming, writing product and tech specs collaboratively, and talking through decisions. There are no leetcode or whiteboard exercises.\n\nOur interview process is three rounds:\n\n 1. Introduction call with Hiring Manager (15 to 30m, live)\n\n 2. A technical screen where we pair in our actual codebase (1h, live)\n\n 3. Three non-coding interviews that focus on product thinking, technical design, and infrastructure (3h 15m, live can be split across multiple days)\n\nDepending on our leadership team’s bandwidth, we may start with an additional 30m screen with a recruiter.\n\nYour hiring manager will be your main point of contact and prep you for interviews. Each round will have written guidance so you know what to expect (you’ll need minimal preparation). You’ll meet 4 to 6 people in engineering (with 5-15 minutes in each interview to ask them questions). If we don’t give an offer, we’ll provide feedback!\n\n\nYOUR FIRST THREE MONTHS AT ASHBY\n\nWe want an exceptional onboarding experience for every new hire. At Ashby, your dev environment is set up with a single script, you push your first product change on day one, and you spend the rest of your time shipping product changes that give you a tour of our codebase and best practices. The product changes increase in scope and ambiguity from simple copy changes to the delivery of a prominent, impactful feature. Your manager will do a 30, 60, and 90-day review to give feedback and calibrate on how we work together.\n\nIt’s a team effort to get you successfully onboarded; you’ll have a peer paired with you to answer questions, pair program, and check in often to see if you need help. The rest of the team will run training sessions on our culture, product, engineering process, and technical architecture.\n\n\nTECHNOLOGY STACK\n\nI’m sharing our tech stack with the caveat that we don’t require previous experience in it (but a love of typed languages is helpful 😀): TypeScript (frontend & backend), React, GraphQL API, Node.js, Postgres, Redis.\n\nWhen they joined Ashby, many of our engineers switched from other languages like Swift and Kotlin (Ben https://linkedin.com/in/benasher44/), platforms like iOS (Tom https://www.linkedin.com/in/tom-quist-0925a199/) and Windows (Sergey https://www.linkedin.com/in/sergeygalich/). We care more about fundamentals (e.g., debugging, abstractions) and how fast you learn. For folks on the team who switched, it's nice seeing changes hot reload versus waiting for XCode to compile 😅.\n\n\nBENEFITS\n\n - Competitive salary and equity.\n\n - 10-year exercise window for stock options. You shouldn’t feel pressure to purchase stock options if you leave Ashby —do it when you feel financially comfortable.\n\n - Unlimited PTO, and we will encourage you to take it.\n\n - A minimum of 12 weeks of fully paid parental leave, covered by Ashby. For folks outside the US, it may be longer to be in line with regional requirements.\n\n - Generous equipment, software, and office furniture budget. Get what you need to be happy and productive!\n\n - $100/month education budget with more expensive items (like conferences) covered with manager approval.\n\n - If you’re in the US, we offer top-tier health insurance for you and your dependents, with 100% of premiums covered by Ashby. In other countries, we provide high-quality supplemental health insurance for you and your dependents, also fully covered by us.\n\nAshby’s success hinges on hiring great people and creating an environment where we can be happy, feel challenged, and do our best work. We’re being deliberate about building that environment from the ground up. I hope that excites you enough to apply.\n\nAshby provides equal employment opportunities (EEO) to all employees and applicants for employment without regard to race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability, genetics, sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression.

We’re looking for a versatile, persistent product engineer who’s not afraid to set up reusable building blocks across the stack and advocate for the time and space to do so. At Ashby, all our engineers ship features end-to-end at a high pace. Example is the best leadership. We’ll give you the room to do your best work, and you'll be our guide! If that speaks to you, read on.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">What Ashby gives you in return is the best of both early and growth-stage environments. The agency and no-nonsense of a seed startup: you write product specs, make product and design decisions, and build in an almost-no-meeting culture. While also the product-market fit and scale of a growth-stage startup: tens of thousands of daily users who depend on your software and eagerly await your next feature.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We have notable customers like Notion, Linear, Shopify, and Snowflake. Our growth and retention metrics are best-in-class among our peers: we have tens of millions in ARR, growing &gt;100% year over year, very low churn, and many years of runway. We’ll share more details once we meet.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You’ve probably seen this role posted before, and it’s because we’re always expanding the team (we’re on track to double this year). We’re bubbling with ideas on how to support Talent Acquisition through software, and we’ve started the journey of building products beyond Talent Acquisition. We read every application and aim to respond to yours within 3-4 days (often sooner).</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1>About the Role and How We Work</h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Our engineering culture strives to recreate the environments where we did our best work as ICs – where we had the ownership and agency to impact our users with creative and innovative software.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">I started my career building software for artists in the Visual Effects industry. It was a formative experience for me as a software engineer because success relied on my ability to be a product manager and designer. I talked to artists to understand their needs. I came up with ideas. I did industry research, designed interfaces, and prototyped ideas. I watched artists use what I built and decided what to tackle in the next iteration. No daily stand-ups, no t-shirt sizing, no planning meetings.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">I studied computer science to solve problems, not tickets, and this felt exactly like that. I not only felt creative and fulfilled but the agency and ownership we were given as engineers powered an incredible amount of innovation.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Innovation came differently (or not at all) at technology startups beyond the seed stage, often through an engineer’s force of will and ability to push back against culture (rather than any encouragement from it). Engineering was narrowed to implementation and delivery, partly due to the influence of other departments and partly due to the influx of \"Agile\" processes like sprint planning. In those companies, I felt like a JIRA jockey. </p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">At Ashby, we’re building an environment that is optimistic about what engineers can own and achieve. An environment that embraces innovative engineers, and, frankly, often stays out of their way. As a Product Engineer, you’ll take ownership over a large portion of one of our products and own projects end-to-end (wearing hats traditionally worn by product and design). You’ll research competitors, write product specs, make wireframes, and more. To ground it with examples, product engineers at Ashby have:</p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Designed and built automated interview scheduling. This feature automates scheduling by calculating possible times from a pool of interviewers and other constraints, and then presenting these times to the candidate for selection via our responsive web app. This solves the “Calendar Tetris” problem I talk about in \"What We're Building.\"</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Built a generalized declarative filter architecture that allows users to create complex filters for any record with a consistent UI and compile it to SQL in our backend. Many user-facing features use it.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Specced, designed, and implemented a feature that allows users to complete signing offers entirely within Ashby. This project involved talking to customers to understand their requirements, deciding what technologies to use, building a prototype, and working with other team members to integrate the final implementation into additional features.</p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1>What We’re Building</h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">As engineers, we are used to tooling that makes us <strong>better</strong> at what we do. When we started Ashby, we saw the opposite with Talent Acquisition software. Recruiting teams were leveling up how they did their work, but instead of software meeting this new standard, it held them back.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Scheduling a final round is an excellent example. Recruiting teams wanted to schedule candidates faster, track interviewer preparation and quality, and do it with half the headcount. A recruiter needed to manually collect availability from the candidate, identify qualified interviewers, perform “Calendar Tetris” to find who is available to interview the candidate, schedule on the earliest date possible, and make any last-minute adjustments as availability changed. They must do this while considering the interview load on each individual and whether interviewers need to be trained and shadowing others. 🥵 TA software didn’t help.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">As hiring managers, we know TA is a critical function, and as engineers, we know software can do better. So, we built and continue to build Ashby to give TA teams the <em>highest</em> standard of tooling. Software that’s intelligent and powerful. Software that provides insights into where they’re failing and automates or simplifies many of the tasks they’re underwater with. We want other functions and departments to be jealous of what TA teams can do with Ashby, and today they often are!</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1>Why You Should or Shouldn’t Apply</h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Software engineers come in many flavors, not all of which fit our model. Here are some things  to help you decide if this fits you and what you’re looking for:</p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You’re not afraid to tackle any part of a technology stack.</em> You do what’s necessary to successfully deliver a feature, whether writing frontend or choosing new infrastructure. We’ll provide a supportive environment to do it successfully (e.g., design system, SRE team).</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You’ve tackled projects with a lot of product and technical ambiguity, and you thrive at the intersection of the two. </em>We’re not building a simple CRUD app, and many of the challenges we tackle require you to use your knowledge of our customers to build powerful abstractions and flexibility in the system to solve a class of problems.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You know how to strike the right balance between speed and quality. </em>Ashby wasn’t built quickly. We took four years to launch publicly because convincing customers to switch required a high-quality product. However, time isn’t infinite, especially for a startup, so we still move with urgency—we’ve built the equivalent of three or more VC-backed startups with a very small team.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You are ambitious and always looking to improve your skills. </em>For most engineers, this role will give you more freedom and responsibilities than you’ve experienced in the past. To thrive (and level up), you’ll need to be open to feedback (and we give lots of it).</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You’re an excellent collaborator and communicator. </em>Ownership and freedom don’t mean you work in a vacuum. You’ll need to vet your decisions with the appropriate stakeholders, keep them up to date when necessary, and work with other engineers to get your projects across the finish line. Clear and concise communication helps a lot here!</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You seek to create leverage in your work. </em>The nature of software is that you can often automate or abstract what would be tedious, time-consuming work. Your impatience usually leads to new abstractions, tools to allow Support to debug before Engineering, new lint rules to prevent common bugs, etc. </p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><strong>Put another way, you shouldn’t apply if:</strong></p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>To you, a tech lead, staff, or principal engineer is someone who spends most of their time project managing or doing architecture reviews. </em>Our most tenured engineers spend most of their time building, and we often trust them with our most challenging problems. While they lead product and technical areas and help other engineers plan their most challenging work, it’s not a requirement, nor do engineers need their sign-off.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You need company-driven process and structure to get your projects across the finish line. </em>Sprint planning and well-defined project management processes are things you need or look to others to lead. You’d rather focus on the technical details and challenges.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You only want to do exciting work. </em>We’re building a team of kind, collaborative folks. Customer issues and investigations are distributed across the team, including our high-level ICs.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You can get lost in the details.</em> Once you start implementation, it can be hard to take a step back and think about the project as a whole. You like everything to be planned upfront.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You haven’t led or taken ownership of projects before.</em> You’re used to working with tech leads and taking on tasks distributed by them.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You want to mentor earlier-career engineers.</em> We rely on engineers owning their projects, so we need engineers with that experience. This requires the team to be reasonably tenured. More than 90% of the team would be considered Senior or above in the industry today, so mentorship opportunities are very limited.</p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1>Engineering Culture</h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Our engineering culture is motivated by Benji’s (my Co-founder and CEO) and my belief that a small, talented team, given the right environment, can build high-quality software fast (and work regular hours!). We do it through:</p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Minimal process with ownership over decisions normally made by product and design</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Natural collaboration and deliberate communication</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Investing in tools and abstractions that give us leverage</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Putting effort into building a diverse team</p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h2><strong>Minimal Process &amp; Lots of Ownership</strong></h2><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">The best engineers we’ve worked with delivered reliably magical outcomes. They took customer problems and relentlessly drove them to solutions that were not only successful but often brilliant and creative. While they did this with minimal oversight, stakeholders were never in the dark as to what was going on, and no setback was a surprise.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Traditional product-development processes aren’t meant for the best engineers. Their purpose is to create consistent outcomes regardless of the engineer’s skill. But, consistency comes at the expense of an engineer’s time and freedom—both ingredients necessary to generate those magical outcomes. As a result, process stifles the best engineers and doesn’t give others the opportunity to practice the behaviors that made the best engineers the “best.”</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">At Ashby, we want to build an environment that encourages every engineer to be their best. So, at Ashby, every Engineer runs their project. Product Managers (and Designers) build strategy, do customer research, and hand off problem briefs to Engineers. Engineers take on the rest: they research the problem, write product specs, build wireframes, and implement their solution end-to-end. We rely on engineers, not process, to push information outward to the relevant folks (e.g., Product Managers) and pull folks in to help (e.g., Designers, Infra). It’s a new level of ownership for many engineers, but we’d rather an engineer fail a bit and coach up their skills than use process as a crutch. Not everyone succeeds in our culture, but those who do <em>thrive</em>.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h2><strong>Collaboration is Natural &amp; Communication is Deliberate</strong></h2><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Our engineering team consists of lifelong learners who are talented but also humble and kind (meet them <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://www.ashbyhq.com/team\"><u>here</u></a>!). These attributes create an environment where collaboration happens naturally. We combine this with research, prototyping, and written proposals to see around corners and get feedback from the team across time zones. Focus time is something that we hold sacred, and, with thoughtful and deliberate communication, engineers are in &lt;2h meetings per week (I wrote about it <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://www.ashbyhq.com/blog/company/thoughtful-communication\"><u>here</u></a>).</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">To drive it home, here's a recent calendar of an engineer who has been with us for over 4 years:</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><div style=\"text-align:left\"><img style=\"max-width:100%\" src=\"https://app.ashbyhq.com/api/images/user-content/4ea5f68e-c33e-4ac9-831a-e732bee4a303/d4679311-9dba-4031-bf5e-19ce78597ab1/calendar.png\" /></div><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We also meet in person at least twice a year, once as a department and once as a company. You also have a small budget to meet up with folks in your city/region.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h2><strong>Increase Leverage, not Team Size</strong></h2><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We built Ashby with the quality, breadth, and depth that many customers would expect from much larger teams over larger time scales. We’ve done this through investment in:</p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><strong>Great developer tooling.</strong> Our CI/CD takes ~10m, and we deploy at least 15x a day. A debugger that works out of the box. Everyone on the team has contributed to our developer experience 💪🏾.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><strong>Building blocks to create powerful and customizable products fast.</strong> At the core of Ashby is a set of common components (analytics modeling and query language, policy engine, workflow engine, design system) that we constantly improve. Each improvement to a common component cascades throughout our app (short video below).</p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Here’s an impromptu quote from Arjun in our company Slack of what it’s like to build a feature at Ashby:</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><div style=\"text-align:left\"><img style=\"max-width:100%\" src=\"https://app.ashbyhq.com/api/images/user-content/4ea5f68e-c33e-4ac9-831a-e732bee4a303/8d94727a-46d8-42a2-9627-ddcd7f822f95/arjun.png\" /></div><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">And a demo of one of these building blocks:</p><div><div style=\"left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:62.5%\"><iframe src=\"https://embedded-media.ashbyhq.com/embed/4ea5f68e-c33e-4ac9-831a-e732bee4a303/9a5f032d-c731-411e-98cf-261517156f01\" style=\"top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0\" allowfullscreen scrolling=\"no\" allow=\"encrypted-media *; picture-in-picture *;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-presentation\"></iframe></div></div><h2><strong>Put Effort into Diversity</strong></h2><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Diverse teams drive innovation and better outcomes. Having seen my mother and partner build their careers as minority women in non-diverse fields, I want to make sure Ashby creates opportunities for the next generation of engineers from underrepresented groups.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Today, 21% of engineers at Ashby are from underrepresented groups. It’s not great, and we are taking conscious steps to improve, like sourcing diverse candidates, providing generous paid family leave, no leetcode interviews, and more.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1><strong>Interview Process</strong></h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">At Ashby, our team and interview process want to help you show your best self. We’ll dive into past projects and simulate working together via pair programming, writing product and tech specs collaboratively, and talking through decisions. There are no leetcode or whiteboard exercises.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Our interview process is three rounds:</p><ol style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Introduction call with Hiring Manager (15 to 30m, live)</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">A technical screen where we pair in our actual codebase (1h, live)</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Three non-coding interviews that focus on product thinking, technical design, and infrastructure (3h 15m, live can be split across multiple days)</p></li></ol><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Depending on our leadership team’s bandwidth, we may start with an <em>additional</em> 30m screen with a recruiter.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Your hiring manager will be your main point of contact and prep you for interviews. Each round will have written guidance so you know what to expect (you’ll need minimal preparation). You’ll meet 4 to 6 people in engineering (with 5-15 minutes in each interview to ask them questions). If we don’t give an offer, we’ll provide feedback!</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1><strong>Your First Three Months at Ashby</strong></h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We want an exceptional onboarding experience for every new hire. At Ashby, your dev environment is set up with a single script, you push your first product change on day one, and you spend the rest of your time shipping product changes that give you a tour of our codebase and best practices. The product changes increase in scope and ambiguity from simple copy changes to the delivery of a prominent, impactful feature. Your manager will do a 30, 60, and 90-day review to give feedback and calibrate on how we work together.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">It’s a team effort to get you successfully onboarded; you’ll have a peer paired with you to answer questions, pair program, and check in often to see if you need help. The rest of the team will run training sessions on our culture, product, engineering process, and technical architecture.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1><strong>Technology Stack</strong></h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">I’m sharing our tech stack with the caveat that we don’t require previous experience in it (but a love of typed languages is helpful 😀): TypeScript (frontend &amp; backend), React, GraphQL API, Node.js, Postgres, Redis.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">When they joined Ashby, many of our engineers switched from other languages like Swift and Kotlin (<a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://linkedin.com/in/benasher44/\"><u>Ben</u></a>), platforms like iOS (<a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/tom-quist-0925a199/\"><u>Tom</u></a>) and Windows (<a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/sergeygalich/\"><u>Sergey</u></a>). We care more about fundamentals (e.g., debugging, abstractions) and how fast you learn. For folks on the team who switched, it's nice seeing changes hot reload versus waiting for XCode to compile 😅.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1><strong>Benefits</strong></h1><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Competitive salary and equity.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">10-year exercise window for stock options. You shouldn’t feel pressure to purchase stock options if you leave Ashby —do it when you feel financially comfortable.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Unlimited PTO, and we will encourage you to take it.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">A minimum of 12 weeks of fully paid parental leave, covered by Ashby. For folks outside the US, it may be longer to be in line with regional requirements.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Generous equipment, software, and office furniture budget. Get what you need to be happy and productive!</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">$100/month education budget with more expensive items (like conferences) covered with manager approval.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">If you’re in the US, we offer top-tier health insurance for you and your dependents, with 100% of premiums covered by Ashby. In other countries, we provide high-quality supplemental health insurance for you and your dependents, also fully covered by us.</p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Ashby’s success hinges on hiring great people and creating an environment where we can be happy, feel challenged, and do our best work. We’re being deliberate about building that environment from the ground up. I hope that excites you enough to apply.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>Ashby provides equal employment opportunities (EEO) to all employees and applicants for employment without regard to race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability, genetics, sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression.

Here are some things to help you decide if this fits you and what you’re looking for:\n\n - You’re not afraid to tackle any part of a technology stack. You do what’s necessary to successfully deliver a feature, whether writing frontend or choosing new infrastructure. We’ll provide a supportive environment to do it successfully (e.g., design system, SRE team).\n\n - You’ve tackled projects with a lot of product and technical ambiguity, and you thrive at the intersection of the two.

You’ll need to vet your decisions with the appropriate stakeholders, keep them up to date when necessary, and work with other engineers to get your projects across the finish line. Clear and concise communication helps a lot here!\n\n - You seek to create leverage in your work. The nature of software is that you can often automate or abstract what would be tedious, time-consuming work. Your impatience usually leads to new abstractions, tools to allow Support to debug before Engineering, new lint rules to prevent common bugs, etc.\n\nPut another way, you shouldn’t apply if:\n\n - To you, a tech lead, staff, or principal engineer is someone who spends most of their time project managing or doing architecture reviews. Our most tenured engineers spend most of their time building, and we often trust them with our most challenging problems. While they lead product and technical areas and help other engineers plan their most challenging work, it’s not a requirement, nor do engineers need their sign-off.\n\n - You need company-driven process and structure to get your projects across the finish line. Sprint planning and well-defined project management processes are things you need or look to others to lead. You’d rather focus on the technical details and challenges.\n\n - You only want to do exciting work. We’re building a team of kind, collaborative folks. Customer issues and investigations are distributed across the team, including our high-level ICs.\n\n - You can get lost in the details. Once you start implementation, it can be hard to take a step back and think about the project as a whole. You like everything to be planned upfront.\n\n - You haven’t led or taken ownership of projects before. You’re used to working with tech leads and taking on tasks distributed by them.\n\n - You want to mentor earlier-career engineers. We rely on engineers owning their projects, so we need engineers with that experience. This requires the team to be reasonably tenured. More than 90% of the team would be considered Senior or above in the industry today, so mentorship opportunities are very limited.\n\n\nENGINEERING CULTURE\n\nOur engineering culture is motivated by Benji’s (my Co-founder and CEO) and my belief that a small, talented team, given the right environment, can build high-quality software fast (and work regular hours!). We do it through:\n\n - Minimal process with ownership over decisions normally made by product and design\n\n - Natural collaboration and deliberate communication\n\n - Investing in tools and abstractions that give us leverage\n\n - Putting effort into building a diverse team\n\n\nMINIMAL PROCESS & LOTS OF OWNERSHIP\n\nThe best engineers we’ve worked with delivered reliably magical outcomes. They took customer problems and relentlessly drove them to solutions that were not only successful but often brilliant and creative. While they did this with minimal oversight, stakeholders were never in the dark as to what was going on, and no setback was a surprise.\n\nTraditional product-development processes aren’t meant for the best engineers. Their purpose is to create consistent outcomes regardless of the engineer’s skill. But, consistency comes at the expense of an engineer’s time and freedom—both ingredients necessary to generate those magical outcomes. As a result, process stifles the best engineers and doesn’t give others the opportunity to practice the behaviors that made the best engineers the “best.”\n\nAt Ashby, we want to build an environment that encourages every engineer to be their best. So, at Ashby, every Engineer runs their project. Product Managers (and Designers) build strategy, do customer research, and hand off problem briefs to Engineers. Engineers take on the rest: they research the problem, write product specs, build wireframes, and implement their solution end-to-end. We rely on engineers, not process, to push information outward to the relevant folks (e.g., Product Managers) and pull folks in to help (e.g., Designers, Infra). It’s a new level of ownership for many engineers, but we’d rather an engineer fail a bit and coach up their skills than use process as a crutch. Not everyone succeeds in our culture, but those who do thrive.\n\n\nCOLLABORATION IS NATURAL & COMMUNICATION IS DELIBERATE\n\nOur engineering team consists of lifelong learners who are talented but also humble and kind (meet them here https://www.ashbyhq.com/team!). These attributes create an environment where collaboration happens naturally. We combine this with research, prototyping, and written proposals to see around corners and get feedback from the team across time zones. Focus time is something that we hold sacred, and, with thoughtful and deliberate communication, engineers are in <2h meetings per week (I wrote about it here https://www.ashbyhq.com/blog/company/thoughtful-communication).\n\nTo drive it home, here's a recent calendar of an engineer who has been with us for over 4 years:\n\n[https://app.ashbyhq.com/api/images/user-content/4ea5f68e-c33e-4ac9-831a-e732bee4a303/d4679311-9dba-4031-bf5e-19ce78597ab1/calendar.png]\n\nWe also meet in person at least twice a year, once as a department and once as a company. You also have a small budget to meet up with folks in your city/region.\n\n\nINCREASE LEVERAGE, NOT TEAM SIZE\n\nWe built Ashby with the quality, breadth, and depth that many customers would expect from much larger teams over larger time scales. We’ve done this through investment in:\n\n - Great developer tooling. Our CI/CD takes ~10m, and we deploy at least 15x a day. A debugger that works out of the box. Everyone on the team has contributed to our developer experience 💪🏾.\n\n - Building blocks to create powerful and customizable products fast. At the core of Ashby is a set of common components (analytics modeling and query language, policy engine, workflow engine, design system) that we constantly improve. Each improvement to a common component cascades throughout our app (short video below).\n\nHere’s an impromptu quote from Arjun in our company Slack of what it’s like to build a feature at Ashby:\n\n[https://app.ashbyhq.com/api/images/user-content/4ea5f68e-c33e-4ac9-831a-e732bee4a303/8d94727a-46d8-42a2-9627-ddcd7f822f95/arjun.png]\n\nAnd a demo of one of these building blocks:\n\n\nPUT EFFORT INTO DIVERSITY\n\nDiverse teams drive innovation and better outcomes. Having seen my mother and partner build their careers as minority women in non-diverse fields, I want to make sure Ashby creates opportunities for the next generation of engineers from underrepresented groups.\n\nToday, 21% of engineers at Ashby are from underrepresented groups. It’s not great, and we are taking conscious steps to improve, like sourcing diverse candidates, providing generous paid family leave, no leetcode interviews, and more.\n\n\nINTERVIEW PROCESS\n\nAt Ashby, our team and interview process want to help you show your best self. We’ll dive into past projects and simulate working together via pair programming, writing product and tech specs collaboratively, and talking through decisions. There are no leetcode or whiteboard exercises.\n\nOur interview process is three rounds:\n\n 1. Introduction call with Hiring Manager (15 to 30m, live)\n\n 2. A technical screen where we pair in our actual codebase (1h, live)\n\n 3. Three non-coding interviews that focus on product thinking, technical design, and infrastructure (3h 15m, live can be split across multiple days)\n\nDepending on our leadership team’s bandwidth, we may start with an additional 30m screen with a recruiter.\n\nYour hiring manager will be your main point of contact and prep you for interviews. Each round will have written guidance so you know what to expect (you’ll need minimal preparation). You’ll meet 4 to 6 people in engineering (with 5-15 minutes in each interview to ask them questions). If we don’t give an offer, we’ll provide feedback!\n\n\nYOUR FIRST THREE MONTHS AT ASHBY\n\nWe want an exceptional onboarding experience for every new hire. At Ashby, your dev environment is set up with a single script, you push your first product change on day one, and you spend the rest of your time shipping product changes that give you a tour of our codebase and best practices. The product changes increase in scope and ambiguity from simple copy changes to the delivery of a prominent, impactful feature. Your manager will do a 30, 60, and 90-day review to give feedback and calibrate on how we work together.\n\nIt’s a team effort to get you successfully onboarded; you’ll have a peer paired with you to answer questions, pair program, and check in often to see if you need help. The rest of the team will run training sessions on our culture, product, engineering process, and technical architecture.\n\n\nTECHNOLOGY STACK\n\nI’m sharing our tech stack with the caveat that we don’t require previous experience in it (but a love of typed languages is helpful 😀): TypeScript (frontend & backend), React, GraphQL API, Node.js, Postgres, Redis.\n\nWhen they joined Ashby, many of our engineers switched from other languages like Swift and Kotlin (Ben https://linkedin.com/in/benasher44/), platforms like iOS (Tom https://www.linkedin.com/in/tom-quist-0925a199/) and Windows (Sergey https://www.linkedin.com/in/sergeygalich/). We care more about fundamentals (e.g., debugging, abstractions) and how fast you learn. For folks on the team who switched, it's nice seeing changes hot reload versus waiting for XCode to compile 😅.\n\n\nBENEFITS\n\n - Competitive salary and equity.\n\n - 10-year exercise window for stock options. You shouldn’t feel pressure to purchase stock options if you leave Ashby —do it when you feel financially comfortable.\n\n - Unlimited PTO, and we will encourage you to take it.\n\n - A minimum of 12 weeks of fully paid parental leave, covered by Ashby. For folks outside the US, it may be longer to be in line with regional requirements.\n\n - Generous equipment, software, and office furniture budget. Get what you need to be happy and productive!\n\n - $100/month education budget with more expensive items (like conferences) covered with manager approval.\n\n - If you’re in the US, we offer top-tier health insurance for you and your dependents, with 100% of premiums covered by Ashby. In other countries, we provide high-quality supplemental health insurance for you and your dependents, also fully covered by us.\n\nAshby’s success hinges on hiring great people and creating an environment where we can be happy, feel challenged, and do our best work. We’re being deliberate about building that environment from the ground up. I hope that excites you enough to apply.\n\nAshby provides equal employment opportunities (EEO) to all employees and applicants for employment without regard to race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability, genetics, sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression.

            "descriptionHtml": "<p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Hi 👋🏾, I’m <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/abhikpramanik/\"><u>Abhik</u></a>, Ashby’s Co-Founder and VP of Engineering. We’re looking for a great (former) engineer who built impressive products and now builds teams of great engineers. Ashby’s success and ambition mean we’re doubling the Engineering team in the next year, and we need your experience and leadership to do it thoughtfully.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Our product and growth are exceptional. Ashby All-in-One is powerful, easy to use, and replaces several venture-backed companies' worth of products (often with a <em>better</em> experience). We have notable customers like Notion, Linear, Shopify, and Snowflake. Our growth and retention metrics are best-in-class among our peers: we have tens of millions in ARR, growing &gt;100% year over year, very low churn, and many years of runway.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">A big part of our secret sauce is how we run Engineering. We achieve incredible speed and quality by discarding many industry norms and being optimistic about Engineers. We consider what makes exceptional Engineers exceptional, figure out how to hire them, and build an environment that gives them the freedom and agency to <em>actually</em> be exceptional. In other words, if engineers writing product specs, making product decisions, and <em>not</em> breaking down projects into individual tickets excites you, you’ve found the right place.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">As an Engineering Manager, you’ll work closely with me, Colin, and your peers to build out the team and continue scaling this unique culture.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You’ll first do that through grassroots leadership. You’ll manage three to five Engineers and hire three to five more. They’ll cover multiple teams and a variety of specializations, from Product Engineers to Site Reliability Engineers to Design Engineers. Your day-to-day will include:</p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Providing feedback on product and technical specs to help engineers identify where to cut scope or improve quality. You don’t make the final decisions, but you’ll influence and coach ICs to reach the right ones.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Grow engineers to the point where they can take large, loosely defined projects and deliver them with little intervention.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Jump into our systems and code to debug a customer issue, ship a small bug fix, or improve our developer experience. Engineering leaders at Ashby are great engineers and enjoy keeping their skills up-to-date (while staying off the critical path).</p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You’ll also propose and lead department and company-wide initiatives. Some examples:</p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Rethink how we (and the industry) do pull request reviews by aligning on goals with the team, sampling a set of PRs to understand how effective they are, and writing a proposal to the team about what we could change to speed up reviews while giving reviewers the time and space to give useful feedback.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Design and improve interviews based on candidate and team feedback. We pride ourselves on thoughtful interviews that simulate actually working with us!</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Improve how we generate and simulate data in demo accounts. It’s a project off the critical path, but it helps you keep up-to-date on our codebase while immensely impacting the business, from Engineering to QA to Sales.</p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">I’ll share more details once we meet.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1><strong>What We’re Building</strong></h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">As engineers, we are used to tooling that makes us <strong>better</strong> at what we do. When we started Ashby, we saw the opposite with Talent Acquisition software. Recruiting teams were leveling up how they did their work, but instead of software meeting this new standard, it held them back.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Scheduling a final round is an excellent example. Recruiting teams wanted to schedule candidates faster, track interviewer preparation and quality, and do it with half the headcount. A recruiter needed to manually collect availability from the candidate, identify qualified interviewers, perform “Calendar Tetris” to find who is available to interview the candidate, schedule on the earliest date possible, and make any last-minute adjustments as availability changed. They must do this while considering the interview load on each individual and whether interviewers need to be trained and shadowing others. 🥵 TA software didn’t help.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">As hiring managers, we know TA is a critical function, and as engineers, we know software can do better. So, we built and continue to build Ashby to give TA teams the <em>highest</em> standard of tooling. Software that’s intelligent and powerful. Software that provides insights into where they’re failing and automates or simplifies many of the tasks they’re underwater with. We want other functions and departments to be jealous of what TA teams can do with Ashby, and today they often are!</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1><strong>Why You Shouldn’t Apply</strong></h1><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You don’t enjoy coding or don’t find time to stay up-to-date on technology.</em> We believe great leaders are folks who were great engineers themselves. That starts with loving the craft and never giving it up.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You follow the rules and accept the hand you’ve been dealt.</em> We want folks with the ambition, courage, and follow-through to change things, whether it’s within their own team or across departments.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You went into management because it was the only growth path available.</em> We want folks who could have been Principal engineers (or were one!).</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You're happy with a team of engineers who are predominantly early-career or mid-career or don't thrive with ownership or autonomy.</em> You believe that with enough guardrails, the team can get things done.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>To you, a Staff or Principal Engineer is someone who spends most of their time project managing or conducting architecture reviews.</em> You don’t believe staff and principal engineers could lead by the example they set or the leverage they create through their work.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You’re not optimistic or convinced that we can build a large engineering team that functions differently from the status quo.</em> You think, at some size, common processes need to be implemented to ensure consistent product delivery (e.g., sprint planning, product managers writing in-depth specifications). You might not say it out loud, but you think, at some size, compromises have to be made for the sake of hiring numbers or consistency.</p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1><strong>Engineering Culture</strong></h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Our engineering culture is motivated by Benji’s (my Co-founder and CEO) and my belief that a small, talented team, given the right environment, can build high-quality software fast (and work regular hours!). We do it through:</p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Minimal process with ownership over decisions normally made by product and design</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Natural collaboration and deliberate communication</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Investing in tools and abstractions that give us leverage</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Putting effort into building a diverse team</p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You’ll be an <em>important</em> <em>part</em> of figuring out how to scale these methods from 50 engineers to 100 and beyond.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h2><strong>Minimal Process &amp; Lots of Ownership</strong></h2><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">The best engineers we’ve worked with delivered reliably magical outcomes. They took customer problems and relentlessly drove them to solutions that were not only successful but often brilliant and creative. While they did this with minimal oversight, stakeholders were never in the dark as to what was going on, and no setback was a surprise.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Traditional product-development processes aren’t meant for the best engineers. Their purpose is to create consistent outcomes regardless of the engineer’s skill. But, consistency comes at the expense of an engineer’s time and freedom—both ingredients necessary to generate those magical outcomes. As a result, process stifles the best engineers and doesn’t give others the opportunity to practice the behaviors that made the best engineers the “best.”</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">At Ashby, we want to build an environment that encourages every engineer to be their best. So, at Ashby, every Engineer runs their project. Product Managers (and Designers) build strategy, do customer research, and hand off problem briefs to Engineers. Engineers take on the rest: they research the problem, write product specs, build wireframes, and implement their solution end-to-end. We rely on engineers, not process, to push information outward to the relevant folks (e.g., Product Managers) and pull folks in to help (e.g., Designers, Infra). It’s a new level of ownership for many engineers, but we’d rather an engineer fail a bit and coach up their skills than use process as a crutch. Not everyone succeeds in our culture, but those who do <em>thrive</em>.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h2><strong>Collaboration is Natural &amp; Communication is Deliberate</strong></h2><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Our engineering team consists of lifelong learners who are talented but also humble and kind (meet them <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://www.ashbyhq.com/team\"><u>here</u></a>!). These attributes create an environment where collaboration happens naturally. We combine this with research, prototyping, and written proposals to see around corners and get feedback from the team across time zones. Focus time is something that we hold sacred, and, with thoughtful and deliberate communication, engineers are in &lt;2h meetings per week (I wrote about it <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://www.ashbyhq.com/blog/company/thoughtful-communication\"><u>here</u></a>).</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">To drive it home, here's a recent calendar of an engineer who has been with us for over 4 years:</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><div style=\"text-align:left\"><img style=\"max-width:100%\" src=\"https://app.ashbyhq.com/api/images/user-content/4ea5f68e-c33e-4ac9-831a-e732bee4a303/d4679311-9dba-4031-bf5e-19ce78597ab1/calendar.png\" /></div><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We also meet in person at least twice a year, once as a department and once as a company. You also have a small budget to meet up with folks in your city/region.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h2><strong>Increase Leverage, not Team Size</strong></h2><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We built Ashby with the quality, breadth, and depth that many customers would expect from much larger teams over larger time scales. We’ve done this through investment in:</p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><strong>Great developer tooling.</strong> Our CI/CD takes ~10m, and we deploy at least 15x a day. A debugger that works out of the box. Everyone on the team has contributed to our developer experience 💪🏾.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><strong>Building blocks to create powerful and customizable products fast.</strong> At the core of Ashby is a set of common components (analytics modeling and query language, policy engine, workflow engine, design system) that we constantly improve. Each improvement to a common component cascades throughout our app (short video below).</p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Here’s an impromptu quote from Arjun in our company Slack of what it’s like to build a feature at Ashby:</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><div style=\"text-align:left\"><img style=\"max-width:100%\" src=\"https://app.ashbyhq.com/api/images/user-content/4ea5f68e-c33e-4ac9-831a-e732bee4a303/8d94727a-46d8-42a2-9627-ddcd7f822f95/arjun.png\" /></div><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">And a demo of one of these building blocks:</p><div><div style=\"left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:62.5%\"><iframe src=\"https://embedded-media.ashbyhq.com/embed/4ea5f68e-c33e-4ac9-831a-e732bee4a303/9a5f032d-c731-411e-98cf-261517156f01\" style=\"top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0\" allowfullscreen scrolling=\"no\" allow=\"encrypted-media *; picture-in-picture *;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-presentation\"></iframe></div></div><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h2><strong>Put Effort into Diversity</strong></h2><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Diverse teams drive innovation and better outcomes. Having seen my mother and partner build their careers as minority women in non-diverse fields, I want to make sure Ashby creates opportunities for the next generation of engineers from underrepresented groups.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Today, 21% of engineers at Ashby are from underrepresented groups. It’s not great, and we are taking conscious steps to improve, like sourcing diverse candidates, providing generous paid family leave, no leetcode interviews, and more.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1><strong>Interview Process</strong></h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">This is an important role and our interview process reflects that both in challenge and length (5h 15m):</p><ol style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Introduction call with me (30m, live)</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">A technical screen where we pair in our actual codebase (1h, live)</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">An interview to explore your past experience as a leader (1h, live)</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Interview with Colin, our Head of EMEA Engineering (45m, live)</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Interview with Benji, our CEO (30m, live)</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Final round where you meet Engineers and other Engineering Managers (90m, live)</p></li></ol><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Depending on my bandwidth, we may start with an <em>additional</em> 30m screen with a recruiter. Near the end of the process, we’ll do reference checks.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">This is also an important decision for you, so I’m always happy to have coffee chats in person or over Zoom to get to know each other. If we don’t move forward, we’re happy to share feedback.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1><strong>Your First Six Months at Ashby</strong></h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Your first three months at Ashby will be spent learning about Ashby Engineering and easing into leadership.

            "descriptionPlain": "Hi 👋🏾, I’m Abhik https://www.linkedin.com/in/abhikpramanik/, Ashby’s Co-Founder and VP of Engineering. We’re looking for a great (former) engineer who built impressive products and now builds teams of great engineers. Ashby’s success and ambition mean we’re doubling the Engineering team in the next year, and we need your experience and leadership to do it thoughtfully.\n\nOur product and growth are exceptional. Ashby All-in-One is powerful, easy to use, and replaces several venture-backed companies' worth of products (often with a better experience). We have notable customers like Notion, Linear, Shopify, and Snowflake. Our growth and retention metrics are best-in-class among our peers: we have tens of millions in ARR, growing >100% year over year, very low churn, and many years of runway.\n\nA big part of our secret sauce is how we run Engineering. We achieve incredible speed and quality by discarding many industry norms and being optimistic about Engineers. We consider what makes exceptional Engineers exceptional, figure out how to hire them, and build an environment that gives them the freedom and agency to actually be exceptional. In other words, if engineers writing product specs, making product decisions, and not breaking down projects into individual tickets excites you, you’ve found the right place.\n\nAs an Engineering Manager, you’ll work closely with me, Colin, and your peers to build out the team and continue scaling this unique culture.\n\nYou’ll first do that through grassroots leadership. You’ll manage three to five Engineers and hire three to five more. They’ll cover multiple teams and a variety of specializations, from Product Engineers to Site Reliability Engineers to Design Engineers. Your day-to-day will include:\n\n - Providing feedback on product and technical specs to help engineers identify where to cut scope or improve quality. You don’t make the final decisions, but you’ll influence and coach ICs to reach the right ones.\n\n - Grow engineers to the point where they can take large, loosely defined projects and deliver them with little intervention.\n\n - Jump into our systems and code to debug a customer issue, ship a small bug fix, or improve our developer experience. Engineering leaders at Ashby are great engineers and enjoy keeping their skills up-to-date (while staying off the critical path).\n\nYou’ll also propose and lead department and company-wide initiatives. Some examples:\n\n - Rethink how we (and the industry) do pull request reviews by aligning on goals with the team, sampling a set of PRs to understand how effective they are, and writing a proposal to the team about what we could change to speed up reviews while giving reviewers the time and space to give useful feedback.\n\n - Design and improve interviews based on candidate and team feedback. We pride ourselves on thoughtful interviews that simulate actually working with us!\n\n - Improve how we generate and simulate data in demo accounts. It’s a project off the critical path, but it helps you keep up-to-date on our codebase while immensely impacting the business, from Engineering to QA to Sales.\n\nI’ll share more details once we meet.\n\n\nWHAT WE’RE BUILDING\n\nAs engineers, we are used to tooling that makes us better at what we do. When we started Ashby, we saw the opposite with Talent Acquisition software. Recruiting teams were leveling up how they did their work, but instead of software meeting this new standard, it held them back.\n\nScheduling a final round is an excellent example. Recruiting teams wanted to schedule candidates faster, track interviewer preparation and quality, and do it with half the headcount. A recruiter needed to manually collect availability from the candidate, identify qualified interviewers, perform “Calendar Tetris” to find who is available to interview the candidate, schedule on the earliest date possible, and make any last-minute adjustments as availability changed. They must do this while considering the interview load on each individual and whether interviewers need to be trained and shadowing others. 🥵 TA software didn’t help.\n\nAs hiring managers, we know TA is a critical function, and as engineers, we know software can do better. So, we built and continue to build Ashby to give TA teams the highest standard of tooling. Software that’s intelligent and powerful. Software that provides insights into where they’re failing and automates or simplifies many of the tasks they’re underwater with. We want other functions and departments to be jealous of what TA teams can do with Ashby, and today they often are!\n\n\nWHY YOU SHOULDN’T APPLY\n\n - You don’t enjoy coding or don’t find time to stay up-to-date on technology. We believe great leaders are folks who were great engineers themselves. That starts with loving the craft and never giving it up.\n\n - You follow the rules and accept the hand you’ve been dealt. We want folks with the ambition, courage, and follow-through to change things, whether it’s within their own team or across departments.\n\n - You went into management because it was the only growth path available. We want folks who could have been Principal engineers (or were one!).\n\n - You're happy with a team of engineers who are predominantly early-career or mid-career or don't thrive with ownership or autonomy. You believe that with enough guardrails, the team can get things done.\n\n - To you, a Staff or Principal Engineer is someone who spends most of their time project managing or conducting architecture reviews. You don’t believe staff and principal engineers could lead by the example they set or the leverage they create through their work.\n\n - You’re not optimistic or convinced that we can build a large engineering team that functions differently from the status quo. You think, at some size, common processes need to be implemented to ensure consistent product delivery (e.g., sprint planning, product managers writing in-depth specifications). You might not say it out loud, but you think, at some size, compromises have to be made for the sake of hiring numbers or consistency.\n\n\nENGINEERING CULTURE\n\nOur engineering culture is motivated by Benji’s (my Co-founder and CEO) and my belief that a small, talented team, given the right environment, can build high-quality software fast (and work regular hours!). We do it through:\n\n - Minimal process with ownership over decisions normally made by product and design\n\n - Natural collaboration and deliberate communication\n\n - Investing in tools and abstractions that give us leverage\n\n - Putting effort into building a diverse team\n\nYou’ll be an important part of figuring out how to scale these methods from 50 engineers to 100 and beyond.\n\n\nMINIMAL PROCESS & LOTS OF OWNERSHIP\n\nThe best engineers we’ve worked with delivered reliably magical outcomes. They took customer problems and relentlessly drove them to solutions that were not only successful but often brilliant and creative. While they did this with minimal oversight, stakeholders were never in the dark as to what was going on, and no setback was a surprise.\n\nTraditional product-development processes aren’t meant for the best engineers. Their purpose is to create consistent outcomes regardless of the engineer’s skill. But, consistency comes at the expense of an engineer’s time and freedom—both ingredients necessary to generate those magical outcomes. As a result, process stifles the best engineers and doesn’t give others the opportunity to practice the behaviors that made the best engineers the “best.”\n\nAt Ashby, we want to build an environment that encourages every engineer to be their best. So, at Ashby, every Engineer runs their project. Product Managers (and Designers) build strategy, do customer research, and hand off problem briefs to Engineers. Engineers take on the rest: they research the problem, write product specs, build wireframes, and implement their solution end-to-end. We rely on engineers, not process, to push information outward to the relevant folks (e.g., Product Managers) and pull folks in to help (e.g., Designers, Infra). It’s a new level of ownership for many engineers, but we’d rather an engineer fail a bit and coach up their skills than use process as a crutch. Not everyone succeeds in our culture, but those who do thrive.\n\n\nCOLLABORATION IS NATURAL & COMMUNICATION IS DELIBERATE\n\nOur engineering team consists of lifelong learners who are talented but also humble and kind (meet them here https://www.ashbyhq.com/team!). These attributes create an environment where collaboration happens naturally. We combine this with research, prototyping, and written proposals to see around corners and get feedback from the team across time zones. Focus time is something that we hold sacred, and, with thoughtful and deliberate communication, engineers are in <2h meetings per week (I wrote about it here https://www.ashbyhq.com/blog/company/thoughtful-communication).\n\nTo drive it home, here's a recent calendar of an engineer who has been with us for over 4 years:\n\n[https://app.ashbyhq.com/api/images/user-content/4ea5f68e-c33e-4ac9-831a-e732bee4a303/d4679311-9dba-4031-bf5e-19ce78597ab1/calendar.png]\n\nWe also meet in person at least twice a year, once as a department and once as a company. You also have a small budget to meet up with folks in your city/region.\n\n\nINCREASE LEVERAGE, NOT TEAM SIZE\n\nWe built Ashby with the quality, breadth, and depth that many customers would expect from much larger teams over larger time scales. We’ve done this through investment in:\n\n - Great developer tooling. Our CI/CD takes ~10m, and we deploy at least 15x a day. A debugger that works out of the box. Everyone on the team has contributed to our developer experience 💪🏾.\n\n - Building blocks to create powerful and customizable products fast. At the core of Ashby is a set of common components (analytics modeling and query language, policy engine, workflow engine, design system) that we constantly improve. Each improvement to a common component cascades throughout our app (short video below).\n\nHere’s an impromptu quote from Arjun in our company Slack of what it’s like to build a feature at Ashby:\n\n[https://app.ashbyhq.com/api/images/user-content/4ea5f68e-c33e-4ac9-831a-e732bee4a303/8d94727a-46d8-42a2-9627-ddcd7f822f95/arjun.png]\n\nAnd a demo of one of these building blocks:\n\n\nPUT EFFORT INTO DIVERSITY\n\nDiverse teams drive innovation and better outcomes. Having seen my mother and partner build their careers as minority women in non-diverse fields, I want to make sure Ashby creates opportunities for the next generation of engineers from underrepresented groups.\n\nToday, 21% of engineers at Ashby are from underrepresented groups. It’s not great, and we are taking conscious steps to improve, like sourcing diverse candidates, providing generous paid family leave, no leetcode interviews, and more.\n\n\nINTERVIEW PROCESS\n\nThis is an important role and our interview process reflects that both in challenge and length (5h 15m):\n\n 1. Introduction call with me (30m, live)\n\n 2. A technical screen where we pair in our actual codebase (1h, live)\n\n 3. An interview to explore your past experience as a leader (1h, live)\n\n 4. Interview with Colin, our Head of EMEA Engineering (45m, live)\n\n 5. Interview with Benji, our CEO (30m, live)\n\n 6. Final round where you meet Engineers and other Engineering Managers (90m, live)\n\nDepending on my bandwidth, we may start with an additional 30m screen with a recruiter. Near the end of the process, we’ll do reference checks.\n\nThis is also an important decision for you, so I’m always happy to have coffee chats in person or over Zoom to get to know each other. If we don’t move forward, we’re happy to share feedback.\n\n\nYOUR FIRST SIX MONTHS AT ASHBY\n\nYour first three months at Ashby will be spent learning about Ashby Engineering and easing into leadership. While most of your onboarding will be driven by a 6-month plan you put together (and refine over time), you’ll also ship some product changes and features. What better way to learn how ICs work than to be one! Don’t worry if you don’t know our technologies. The team is really helpful and our dev environment is pretty awesome: it sets up in a single script and you’ll be able to push your first product change on day one.\n\nYou and I will do 30-day, 60-day, 90-day, and 6-month reviews to calibrate on our unique culture and how you, I, and the team will work together.\n\n\nBENEFITS\n\n - Competitive salary and equity.\n\n - 10-year exercise window for stock options. You shouldn’t feel pressure to purchase stock options if you leave Ashby —do it when you feel financially comfortable.\n\n - Unlimited PTO.\n\n - A minimum of 12 weeks of fully paid parental leave, covered by Ashby. For folks outside the US, it may be longer to be in line with regional requirements.\n\n - Generous equipment, software, and office furniture budget. Get what you need to be happy and productive!\n\n - $100/month education budget with more expensive items (like conferences) covered with manager approval.\n\n - If you’re in the US, we offer top-tier health insurance for you and your dependents, with 100% of premiums covered by Ashby. In other countries, we provide high-quality supplemental health insurance for you and your dependents, also fully covered by us.\n\nAshby’s success hinges on hiring great people and creating an environment where we can be happy, feel challenged, and do our best work. We’re being deliberate about building that environment from the ground up. I hope that excites you enough to apply.\n\nAshby provides equal employment opportunities (EEO) to all employees and applicants for employment without regard to race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability, genetics, sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression.

            "descriptionHtml": "<p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Hi 👋🏾 I’m <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/abhikpramanik\"><u>Abhik</u></a>, Ashby's Co-Founder and VP of Engineering. We’re looking for a versatile, persistent product engineer who’s not afraid to set up reusable building blocks across the stack and advocate for the time and space to do so. At Ashby, all our engineers ship features end-to-end at a high pace. Example is the best leadership. We’ll give you the room to do your best work, and you'll be our guide! If that speaks to you, read on.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">What Ashby gives you in return is the best of both early and growth-stage environments. The agency and no-nonsense of a seed startup: you write product specs, make product and design decisions, and build in an almost-no-meeting culture. While also the product-market fit and scale of a growth-stage startup: tens of thousands of daily users who depend on your software and eagerly await your next feature.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We have notable customers like Notion, Linear, Shopify, and Snowflake. Our growth and retention metrics are best-in-class among our peers: we have tens of millions in ARR, growing &gt;100% year over year, very low churn, and many years of runway. We’ll share more details once we meet.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You’ve probably seen this role posted before, and it’s because we’re always expanding the team (we’re on track to double this year). We’re bubbling with ideas on how to support Talent Acquisition through software, and we’ve started the journey of building products beyond Talent Acquisition. We read every application and aim to respond to yours within 3-4 days (often sooner).</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1>About the Role and How We Work</h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Our engineering culture strives to recreate the environments where we did our best work as ICs – where we had the ownership and agency to impact our users with creative and innovative software.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">I started my career building software for artists in the Visual Effects industry. It was a formative experience for me as a software engineer because success relied on my ability to be a product manager and designer. I talked to artists to understand their needs. I came up with ideas. I did industry research, designed interfaces, and prototyped ideas. I watched artists use what I built and decided what to tackle in the next iteration. No daily stand-ups, no t-shirt sizing, no planning meetings.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">I studied computer science to solve problems, not tickets, and this felt exactly like that. I not only felt creative and fulfilled but the agency and ownership we were given as engineers powered an incredible amount of innovation.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Innovation came differently (or not at all) at technology startups beyond the seed stage, often through an engineer’s force of will and ability to push back against culture (rather than any encouragement from it). Engineering was narrowed to implementation and delivery, partly due to the influence of other departments and partly due to the influx of \"Agile\" processes like sprint planning. In those companies, I felt like a JIRA jockey. </p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">At Ashby, we’re building an environment that is optimistic about what engineers can own and achieve. An environment that embraces innovative engineers, and, frankly, often stays out of their way. As a Product Engineer, you’ll take ownership over a large portion of one of our products and own projects end-to-end (wearing hats traditionally worn by product and design). You’ll research competitors, write product specs, make wireframes, and more. To ground it with examples, product engineers at Ashby have:</p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Designed and built automated interview scheduling. This feature automates scheduling by calculating possible times from a pool of interviewers and other constraints, and then presenting these times to the candidate for selection via our responsive web app. This solves the “Calendar Tetris” problem I talk about in \"What We're Building.\"</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Built a generalized declarative filter architecture that allows users to create complex filters for any record with a consistent UI and compile it to SQL in our backend. Many user-facing features use it.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Specced, designed, and implemented a feature that allows users to complete signing offers entirely within Ashby. This project involved talking to customers to understand their requirements, deciding what technologies to use, building a prototype, and working with other team members to integrate the final implementation into additional features.</p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1>What We’re Building</h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">As engineers, we are used to tooling that makes us <strong>better</strong> at what we do. When we started Ashby, we saw the opposite with Talent Acquisition software. Recruiting teams were leveling up how they did their work, but instead of software meeting this new standard, it held them back.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Scheduling a final round is an excellent example. Recruiting teams wanted to schedule candidates faster, track interviewer preparation and quality, and do it with half the headcount. A recruiter needed to manually collect availability from the candidate, identify qualified interviewers, perform “Calendar Tetris” to find who is available to interview the candidate, schedule on the earliest date possible, and make any last-minute adjustments as availability changed. They must do this while considering the interview load on each individual and whether interviewers need to be trained and shadowing others. 🥵 TA software didn’t help.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">As hiring managers, we know TA is a critical function, and as engineers, we know software can do better. So, we built and continue to build Ashby to give TA teams the <em>highest</em> standard of tooling. Software that’s intelligent and powerful. Software that provides insights into where they’re failing and automates or simplifies many of the tasks they’re underwater with. We want other functions and departments to be jealous of what TA teams can do with Ashby, and today they often are!</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1>Why You Should or Shouldn’t Apply</h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Software engineers come in many flavors, not all of which fit our model. Here are some things  to help you decide if this fits you and what you’re looking for:</p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You’re not afraid to tackle any part of a technology stack.</em> You do what’s necessary to successfully deliver a feature, whether writing frontend or choosing new infrastructure. We’ll provide a supportive environment to do it successfully (e.g., design system, SRE team).</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You’ve tackled projects with a lot of product and technical ambiguity, and you thrive at the intersection of the two. </em>We’re not building a simple CRUD app, and many of the challenges we tackle require you to use your knowledge of our customers to build powerful abstractions and flexibility in the system to solve a class of problems.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You know how to strike the right balance between speed and quality. </em>Ashby wasn’t built quickly. We took four years to launch publicly because convincing customers to switch required a high-quality product. However, time isn’t infinite, especially for a startup, so we still move with urgency—we’ve built the equivalent of three or more VC-backed startups with a very small team.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You are ambitious and always looking to improve your skills. </em>For most engineers, this role will give you more freedom and responsibilities than you’ve experienced in the past. To thrive (and level up), you’ll need to be open to feedback (and we give lots of it).</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You’re an excellent collaborator and communicator. </em>Ownership and freedom don’t mean you work in a vacuum. You’ll need to vet your decisions with the appropriate stakeholders, keep them up to date when necessary, and work with other engineers to get your projects across the finish line. Clear and concise communication helps a lot here!</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You seek to create leverage in your work. </em>The nature of software is that you can often automate or abstract what would be tedious, time-consuming work. Your impatience usually leads to new abstractions, tools to allow Support to debug before Engineering, new lint rules to prevent common bugs, etc. </p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><strong>Put another way, you shouldn’t apply if:</strong></p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>To you, a tech lead, staff, or principal engineer is someone who spends most of their time project managing or doing architecture reviews. </em>Our most tenured engineers spend most of their time building, and we often trust them with our most challenging problems. While they lead product and technical areas and help other engineers plan their most challenging work, it’s not a requirement, nor do engineers need their sign-off.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You need company-driven process and structure to get your projects across the finish line. </em>Sprint planning and well-defined project management processes are things you need or look to others to lead. You’d rather focus on the technical details and challenges.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You only want to do exciting work. </em>We’re building a team of kind, collaborative folks. Customer issues and investigations are distributed across the team, including our high-level ICs.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You can get lost in the details.</em> Once you start implementation, it can be hard to take a step back and think about the project as a whole. You like everything to be planned upfront.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You haven’t led or taken ownership of projects before.</em> You’re used to working with tech leads and taking on tasks distributed by them.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>You want to mentor earlier-career engineers.</em> We rely on engineers owning their projects, so we need engineers with that experience. This requires the team to be reasonably tenured. More than 90% of the team would be considered Senior or above in the industry today, so mentorship opportunities are very limited.</p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1>Engineering Culture</h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Our engineering culture is motivated by Benji’s (my Co-founder and CEO) and my belief that a small, talented team, given the right environment, can build high-quality software fast (and work regular hours!). We do it through:</p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Minimal process with ownership over decisions normally made by product and design</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Natural collaboration and deliberate communication</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Investing in tools and abstractions that give us leverage</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Putting effort into building a diverse team</p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h2><strong>Minimal Process &amp; Lots of Ownership</strong></h2><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">The best engineers we’ve worked with delivered reliably magical outcomes. They took customer problems and relentlessly drove them to solutions that were not only successful but often brilliant and creative. While they did this with minimal oversight, stakeholders were never in the dark as to what was going on, and no setback was a surprise.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Traditional product-development processes aren’t meant for the best engineers. Their purpose is to create consistent outcomes regardless of the engineer’s skill. But, consistency comes at the expense of an engineer’s time and freedom—both ingredients necessary to generate those magical outcomes. As a result, process stifles the best engineers and doesn’t give others the opportunity to practice the behaviors that made the best engineers the “best.”</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">At Ashby, we want to build an environment that encourages every engineer to be their best. So, at Ashby, every Engineer runs their project. Product Managers (and Designers) build strategy, do customer research, and hand off problem briefs to Engineers. Engineers take on the rest: they research the problem, write product specs, build wireframes, and implement their solution end-to-end. We rely on engineers, not process, to push information outward to the relevant folks (e.g., Product Managers) and pull folks in to help (e.g., Designers, Infra). It’s a new level of ownership for many engineers, but we’d rather an engineer fail a bit and coach up their skills than use process as a crutch. Not everyone succeeds in our culture, but those who do <em>thrive</em>.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h2><strong>Collaboration is Natural &amp; Communication is Deliberate</strong></h2><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Our engineering team consists of lifelong learners who are talented but also humble and kind (meet them <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://www.ashbyhq.com/team\"><u>here</u></a>!). These attributes create an environment where collaboration happens naturally. We combine this with research, prototyping, and written proposals to see around corners and get feedback from the team across time zones. Focus time is something that we hold sacred, and, with thoughtful and deliberate communication, engineers are in &lt;2h meetings per week (I wrote about it <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://www.ashbyhq.com/blog/company/thoughtful-communication\"><u>here</u></a>).</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">To drive it home, here's a recent calendar of an engineer who has been with us for over 4 years:</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><div style=\"text-align:left\"><img style=\"max-width:100%\" src=\"https://app.ashbyhq.com/api/images/user-content/4ea5f68e-c33e-4ac9-831a-e732bee4a303/d4679311-9dba-4031-bf5e-19ce78597ab1/calendar.png\" /></div><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We also meet in person at least twice a year, once as a department and once as a company. You also have a small budget to meet up with folks in your city/region.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h2><strong>Increase Leverage, not Team Size</strong></h2><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We built Ashby with the quality, breadth, and depth that many customers would expect from much larger teams over larger time scales. We’ve done this through investment in:</p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><strong>Great developer tooling.</strong> Our CI/CD takes ~10m, and we deploy at least 15x a day. A debugger that works out of the box. Everyone on the team has contributed to our developer experience 💪🏾.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><strong>Building blocks to create powerful and customizable products fast.</strong> At the core of Ashby is a set of common components (analytics modeling and query language, policy engine, workflow engine, design system) that we constantly improve. Each improvement to a common component cascades throughout our app (short video below).</p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Here’s an impromptu quote from Arjun in our company Slack of what it’s like to build a feature at Ashby:</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><div style=\"text-align:left\"><img style=\"max-width:100%\" src=\"https://app.ashbyhq.com/api/images/user-content/4ea5f68e-c33e-4ac9-831a-e732bee4a303/8d94727a-46d8-42a2-9627-ddcd7f822f95/arjun.png\" /></div><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">And a demo of one of these building blocks:</p><div><div style=\"left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:62.5%\"><iframe src=\"https://embedded-media.ashbyhq.com/embed/4ea5f68e-c33e-4ac9-831a-e732bee4a303/9a5f032d-c731-411e-98cf-261517156f01\" style=\"top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0\" allowfullscreen scrolling=\"no\" allow=\"encrypted-media *; picture-in-picture *;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-presentation\"></iframe></div></div><h2><strong>Put Effort into Diversity</strong></h2><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Diverse teams drive innovation and better outcomes. Having seen my mother and partner build their careers as minority women in non-diverse fields, I want to make sure Ashby creates opportunities for the next generation of engineers from underrepresented groups.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Today, 21% of engineers at Ashby are from underrepresented groups. It’s not great, and we are taking conscious steps to improve, like sourcing diverse candidates, providing generous paid family leave, no leetcode interviews, and more.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1><strong>Interview Process</strong></h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">At Ashby, our team and interview process want to help you show your best self. We’ll dive into past projects and simulate working together via pair programming, writing product and tech specs collaboratively, and talking through decisions. There are no leetcode or whiteboard exercises.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Our interview process is three rounds:</p><ol style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Introduction call with Hiring Manager (15 to 30m, live)</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">A technical screen where we pair in our actual codebase (1h, live)</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Three non-coding interviews that focus on product thinking, technical design, and infrastructure (3h 15m, live can be split across multiple days)</p></li></ol><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Depending on our leadership team’s bandwidth, we may start with an <em>additional</em> 30m screen with a recruiter.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Your hiring manager will be your main point of contact and prep you for interviews. Each round will have written guidance so you know what to expect (you’ll need minimal preparation). You’ll meet 4 to 6 people in engineering (with 5-15 minutes in each interview to ask them questions). If we don’t give an offer, we’ll provide feedback!</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1><strong>Your First Three Months at Ashby</strong></h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We want an exceptional onboarding experience for every new hire. At Ashby, your dev environment is set up with a single script, you push your first product change on day one, and you spend the rest of your time shipping product changes that give you a tour of our codebase and best practices. The product changes increase in scope and ambiguity from simple copy changes to the delivery of a prominent, impactful feature. Your manager will do a 30, 60, and 90-day review to give feedback and calibrate on how we work together.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">It’s a team effort to get you successfully onboarded; you’ll have a peer paired with you to answer questions, pair program, and check in often to see if you need help. The rest of the team will run training sessions on our culture, product, engineering process, and technical architecture.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1><strong>Technology Stack</strong></h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">I’m sharing our tech stack with the caveat that we don’t require previous experience in it (but a love of typed languages is helpful 😀): TypeScript (frontend &amp; backend), React, GraphQL API, Node.js, Postgres, Redis.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">When they joined Ashby, many of our engineers switched from other languages like Swift and Kotlin (<a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://linkedin.com/in/benasher44/\"><u>Ben</u></a>), platforms like iOS (<a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/tom-quist-0925a199/\"><u>Tom</u></a>) and Windows (<a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/sergeygalich/\"><u>Sergey</u></a>). We care more about fundamentals (e.g., debugging, abstractions) and how fast you learn. For folks on the team who switched, it's nice seeing changes hot reload versus waiting for XCode to compile 😅.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1><strong>Benefits</strong></h1><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Competitive salary and equity.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">10-year exercise window for stock options. You shouldn’t feel pressure to purchase stock options if you leave Ashby —do it when you feel financially comfortable.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Unlimited PTO, and we will encourage you to take it.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">A minimum of 12 weeks of fully paid parental leave, covered by Ashby. For folks outside the US, it may be longer to be in line with regional requirements.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Generous equipment, software, and office furniture budget. Get what you need to be happy and productive!</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">$100/month education budget with more expensive items (like conferences) covered with manager approval.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">If you’re in the US, we offer top-tier health insurance for you and your dependents, with 100% of premiums covered by Ashby.

            "descriptionPlain": "Hi 👋🏾 I’m Abhik https://www.linkedin.com/in/abhikpramanik, Ashby's Co-Founder and VP of Engineering. We’re looking for a versatile, persistent product engineer who’s not afraid to set up reusable building blocks across the stack and advocate for the time and space to do so. At Ashby, all our engineers ship features end-to-end at a high pace. Example is the best leadership. We’ll give you the room to do your best work, and you'll be our guide! If that speaks to you, read on.\n\nWhat Ashby gives you in return is the best of both early and growth-stage environments. The agency and no-nonsense of a seed startup: you write product specs, make product and design decisions, and build in an almost-no-meeting culture. While also the product-market fit and scale of a growth-stage startup: tens of thousands of daily users who depend on your software and eagerly await your next feature.\n\nWe have notable customers like Notion, Linear, Shopify, and Snowflake. Our growth and retention metrics are best-in-class among our peers: we have tens of millions in ARR, growing >100% year over year, very low churn, and many years of runway. We’ll share more details once we meet.\n\nYou’ve probably seen this role posted before, and it’s because we’re always expanding the team (we’re on track to double this year). We’re bubbling with ideas on how to support Talent Acquisition through software, and we’ve started the journey of building products beyond Talent Acquisition. We read every application and aim to respond to yours within 3-4 days (often sooner).\n\n\nABOUT THE ROLE AND HOW WE WORK\n\nOur engineering culture strives to recreate the environments where we did our best work as ICs – where we had the ownership and agency to impact our users with creative and innovative software.\n\nI started my career building software for artists in the Visual Effects industry. It was a formative experience for me as a software engineer because success relied on my ability to be a product manager and designer. I talked to artists to understand their needs. I came up with ideas. I did industry research, designed interfaces, and prototyped ideas. I watched artists use what I built and decided what to tackle in the next iteration. No daily stand-ups, no t-shirt sizing, no planning meetings.\n\nI studied computer science to solve problems, not tickets, and this felt exactly like that. I not only felt creative and fulfilled but the agency and ownership we were given as engineers powered an incredible amount of innovation.\n\nInnovation came differently (or not at all) at technology startups beyond the seed stage, often through an engineer’s force of will and ability to push back against culture (rather than any encouragement from it). Engineering was narrowed to implementation and delivery, partly due to the influence of other departments and partly due to the influx of \"Agile\" processes like sprint planning. In those companies, I felt like a JIRA jockey.\n\nAt Ashby, we’re building an environment that is optimistic about what engineers can own and achieve. An environment that embraces innovative engineers, and, frankly, often stays out of their way. As a Product Engineer, you’ll take ownership over a large portion of one of our products and own projects end-to-end (wearing hats traditionally worn by product and design). You’ll research competitors, write product specs, make wireframes, and more. To ground it with examples, product engineers at Ashby have:\n\n - Designed and built automated interview scheduling. This feature automates scheduling by calculating possible times from a pool of interviewers and other constraints, and then presenting these times to the candidate for selection via our responsive web app. This solves the “Calendar Tetris” problem I talk about in \"What We're Building.\"\n\n - Built a generalized declarative filter architecture that allows users to create complex filters for any record with a consistent UI and compile it to SQL in our backend. Many user-facing features use it.\n\n - Specced, designed, and implemented a feature that allows users to complete signing offers entirely within Ashby. This project involved talking to customers to understand their requirements, deciding what technologies to use, building a prototype, and working with other team members to integrate the final implementation into additional features.\n\n\nWHAT WE’RE BUILDING\n\nAs engineers, we are used to tooling that makes us better at what we do. When we started Ashby, we saw the opposite with Talent Acquisition software. Recruiting teams were leveling up how they did their work, but instead of software meeting this new standard, it held them back.\n\nScheduling a final round is an excellent example. Recruiting teams wanted to schedule candidates faster, track interviewer preparation and quality, and do it with half the headcount. A recruiter needed to manually collect availability from the candidate, identify qualified interviewers, perform “Calendar Tetris” to find who is available to interview the candidate, schedule on the earliest date possible, and make any last-minute adjustments as availability changed. They must do this while considering the interview load on each individual and whether interviewers need to be trained and shadowing others. 🥵 TA software didn’t help.\n\nAs hiring managers, we know TA is a critical function, and as engineers, we know software can do better. So, we built and continue to build Ashby to give TA teams the highest standard of tooling. Software that’s intelligent and powerful. Software that provides insights into where they’re failing and automates or simplifies many of the tasks they’re underwater with. We want other functions and departments to be jealous of what TA teams can do with Ashby, and today they often are!\n\n\nWHY YOU SHOULD OR SHOULDN’T APPLY\n\nSoftware engineers come in many flavors, not all of which fit our model. Here are some things to help you decide if this fits you and what you’re looking for:\n\n - You’re not afraid to tackle any part of a technology stack. You do what’s necessary to successfully deliver a feature, whether writing frontend or choosing new infrastructure. We’ll provide a supportive environment to do it successfully (e.g., design system, SRE team).\n\n - You’ve tackled projects with a lot of product and technical ambiguity, and you thrive at the intersection of the two. We’re not building a simple CRUD app, and many of the challenges we tackle require you to use your knowledge of our customers to build powerful abstractions and flexibility in the system to solve a class of problems.\n\n - You know how to strike the right balance between speed and quality. Ashby wasn’t built quickly. We took four years to launch publicly because convincing customers to switch required a high-quality product. However, time isn’t infinite, especially for a startup, so we still move with urgency—we’ve built the equivalent of three or more VC-backed startups with a very small team.\n\n - You are ambitious and always looking to improve your skills. For most engineers, this role will give you more freedom and responsibilities than you’ve experienced in the past. To thrive (and level up), you’ll need to be open to feedback (and we give lots of it).\n\n - You’re an excellent collaborator and communicator. Ownership and freedom don’t mean you work in a vacuum. You’ll need to vet your decisions with the appropriate stakeholders, keep them up to date when necessary, and work with other engineers to get your projects across the finish line. Clear and concise communication helps a lot here!\n\n - You seek to create leverage in your work. The nature of software is that you can often automate or abstract what would be tedious, time-consuming work. Your impatience usually leads to new abstractions, tools to allow Support to debug before Engineering, new lint rules to prevent common bugs, etc.\n\nPut another way, you shouldn’t apply if:\n\n - To you, a tech lead, staff, or principal engineer is someone who spends most of their time project managing or doing architecture reviews. Our most tenured engineers spend most of their time building, and we often trust them with our most challenging problems. While they lead product and technical areas and help other engineers plan their most challenging work, it’s not a requirement, nor do engineers need their sign-off.\n\n - You need company-driven process and structure to get your projects across the finish line. Sprint planning and well-defined project management processes are things you need or look to others to lead. You’d rather focus on the technical details and challenges.\n\n - You only want to do exciting work. We’re building a team of kind, collaborative folks. Customer issues and investigations are distributed across the team, including our high-level ICs.\n\n - You can get lost in the details. Once you start implementation, it can be hard to take a step back and think about the project as a whole. You like everything to be planned upfront.\n\n - You haven’t led or taken ownership of projects before. You’re used to working with tech leads and taking on tasks distributed by them.\n\n - You want to mentor earlier-career engineers. We rely on engineers owning their projects, so we need engineers with that experience. This requires the team to be reasonably tenured. More than 90% of the team would be considered Senior or above in the industry today, so mentorship opportunities are very limited.\n\n\nENGINEERING CULTURE\n\nOur engineering culture is motivated by Benji’s (my Co-founder and CEO) and my belief that a small, talented team, given the right environment, can build high-quality software fast (and work regular hours!). We do it through:\n\n - Minimal process with ownership over decisions normally made by product and design\n\n - Natural collaboration and deliberate communication\n\n - Investing in tools and abstractions that give us leverage\n\n - Putting effort into building a diverse team\n\n\nMINIMAL PROCESS & LOTS OF OWNERSHIP\n\nThe best engineers we’ve worked with delivered reliably magical outcomes. They took customer problems and relentlessly drove them to solutions that were not only successful but often brilliant and creative. While they did this with minimal oversight, stakeholders were never in the dark as to what was going on, and no setback was a surprise.\n\nTraditional product-development processes aren’t meant for the best engineers. Their purpose is to create consistent outcomes regardless of the engineer’s skill. But, consistency comes at the expense of an engineer’s time and freedom—both ingredients necessary to generate those magical outcomes. As a result, process stifles the best engineers and doesn’t give others the opportunity to practice the behaviors that made the best engineers the “best.”\n\nAt Ashby, we want to build an environment that encourages every engineer to be their best. So, at Ashby, every Engineer runs their project. Product Managers (and Designers) build strategy, do customer research, and hand off problem briefs to Engineers. Engineers take on the rest: they research the problem, write product specs, build wireframes, and implement their solution end-to-end. We rely on engineers, not process, to push information outward to the relevant folks (e.g., Product Managers) and pull folks in to help (e.g., Designers, Infra). It’s a new level of ownership for many engineers, but we’d rather an engineer fail a bit and coach up their skills than use process as a crutch. Not everyone succeeds in our culture, but those who do thrive.\n\n\nCOLLABORATION IS NATURAL & COMMUNICATION IS DELIBERATE\n\nOur engineering team consists of lifelong learners who are talented but also humble and kind (meet them here https://www.ashbyhq.com/team!). These attributes create an environment where collaboration happens naturally. We combine this with research, prototyping, and written proposals to see around corners and get feedback from the team across time zones. Focus time is something that we hold sacred, and, with thoughtful and deliberate communication, engineers are in <2h meetings per week (I wrote about it here https://www.ashbyhq.com/blog/company/thoughtful-communication).\n\nTo drive it home, here's a recent calendar of an engineer who has been with us for over 4 years:\n\n[https://app.ashbyhq.com/api/images/user-content/4ea5f68e-c33e-4ac9-831a-e732bee4a303/d4679311-9dba-4031-bf5e-19ce78597ab1/calendar.png]\n\nWe also meet in person at least twice a year, once as a department and once as a company. You also have a small budget to meet up with folks in your city/region.\n\n\nINCREASE LEVERAGE, NOT TEAM SIZE\n\nWe built Ashby with the quality, breadth, and depth that many customers would expect from much larger teams over larger time scales. We’ve done this through investment in:\n\n - Great developer tooling. Our CI/CD takes ~10m, and we deploy at least 15x a day. A debugger that works out of the box. Everyone on the team has contributed to our developer experience 💪🏾.\n\n - Building blocks to create powerful and customizable products fast. At the core of Ashby is a set of common components (analytics modeling and query language, policy engine, workflow engine, design system) that we constantly improve. Each improvement to a common component cascades throughout our app (short video below).\n\nHere’s an impromptu quote from Arjun in our company Slack of what it’s like to build a feature at Ashby:\n\n[https://app.ashbyhq.com/api/images/user-content/4ea5f68e-c33e-4ac9-831a-e732bee4a303/8d94727a-46d8-42a2-9627-ddcd7f822f95/arjun.png]\n\nAnd a demo of one of these building blocks:\n\n\nPUT EFFORT INTO DIVERSITY\n\nDiverse teams drive innovation and better outcomes. Having seen my mother and partner build their careers as minority women in non-diverse fields, I want to make sure Ashby creates opportunities for the next generation of engineers from underrepresented groups.\n\nToday, 21% of engineers at Ashby are from underrepresented groups. It’s not great, and we are taking conscious steps to improve, like sourcing diverse candidates, providing generous paid family leave, no leetcode interviews, and more.\n\n\nINTERVIEW PROCESS\n\nAt Ashby, our team and interview process want to help you show your best self. We’ll dive into past projects and simulate working together via pair programming, writing product and tech specs collaboratively, and talking through decisions. There are no leetcode or whiteboard exercises.\n\nOur interview process is three rounds:\n\n 1. Introduction call with Hiring Manager (15 to 30m, live)\n\n 2. A technical screen where we pair in our actual codebase (1h, live)\n\n 3. Three non-coding interviews that focus on product thinking, technical design, and infrastructure (3h 15m, live can be split across multiple days)\n\nDepending on our leadership team’s bandwidth, we may start with an additional 30m screen with a recruiter.\n\nYour hiring manager will be your main point of contact and prep you for interviews. Each round will have written guidance so you know what to expect (you’ll need minimal preparation). You’ll meet 4 to 6 people in engineering (with 5-15 minutes in each interview to ask them questions). If we don’t give an offer, we’ll provide feedback!\n\n\nYOUR FIRST THREE MONTHS AT ASHBY\n\nWe want an exceptional onboarding experience for every new hire. At Ashby, your dev environment is set up with a single script, you push your first product change on day one, and you spend the rest of your time shipping product changes that give you a tour of our codebase and best practices. The product changes increase in scope and ambiguity from simple copy changes to the delivery of a prominent, impactful feature. Your manager will do a 30, 60, and 90-day review to give feedback and calibrate on how we work together.\n\nIt’s a team effort to get you successfully onboarded; you’ll have a peer paired with you to answer questions, pair program, and check in often to see if you need help. The rest of the team will run training sessions on our culture, product, engineering process, and technical architecture.\n\n\nTECHNOLOGY STACK\n\nI’m sharing our tech stack with the caveat that we don’t require previous experience in it (but a love of typed languages is helpful 😀): TypeScript (frontend & backend), React, GraphQL API, Node.js, Postgres, Redis.\n\nWhen they joined Ashby, many of our engineers switched from other languages like Swift and Kotlin (Ben https://linkedin.com/in/benasher44/), platforms like iOS (Tom https://www.linkedin.com/in/tom-quist-0925a199/) and Windows (Sergey https://www.linkedin.com/in/sergeygalich/). We care more about fundamentals (e.g., debugging, abstractions) and how fast you learn. For folks on the team who switched, it's nice seeing changes hot reload versus waiting for XCode to compile 😅.\n\n\nBENEFITS\n\n - Competitive salary and equity.\n\n - 10-year exercise window for stock options. You shouldn’t feel pressure to purchase stock options if you leave Ashby —do it when you feel financially comfortable.\n\n - Unlimited PTO, and we will encourage you to take it.\n\n - A minimum of 12 weeks of fully paid parental leave, covered by Ashby. For folks outside the US, it may be longer to be in line with regional requirements.\n\n - Generous equipment, software, and office furniture budget. Get what you need to be happy and productive!\n\n - $100/month education budget with more expensive items (like conferences) covered with manager approval.\n\n - If you’re in the US, we offer top-tier health insurance for you and your dependents, with 100% of premiums covered by Ashby. In other countries, we provide high-quality supplemental health insurance for you and your dependents, also fully covered by us.\n\nAshby’s success hinges on hiring great people and creating an environment where we can be happy, feel challenged, and do our best work. We’re being deliberate about building that environment from the ground up. I hope that excites you enough to apply.\n\nAshby provides equal employment opportunities (EEO) to all employees and applicants for employment without regard to race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability, genetics, sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression. We are committed to a diverse and inclusive workforce and welcome people from all backgrounds, experiences, perspectives, and abilities.",

            "descriptionHtml": "<p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We’re looking for a curious, rigorous, problem-hungry platform engineer (who codes!) to carry the ball as we bring Ashby to the big leagues. Ashby builds software that lets talent teams build an efficient, delightful, respectful hiring process. Similarly, you’re an engineer who wants to build a “paved road” that excellent engineering teams can safely take to the moon and back.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We have notable customers like Notion, Linear, Shopify, and Snowflake. Our growth and retention metrics are best-in-class among our peers: we have tens of millions in ARR, growing &gt;100% year over year, over 2500 customers, very low churn, and many years of runway. We’ll share more details once we meet, but you now probably have a good idea as to why we're hiring for this role 😅.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We’ve listed this role twice: as a Platform Engineer and Site Reliability Engineer – our team does both, and we are open to candidates who lean towards one or the other. </p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1>About the role and how we work</h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Hi 👋 I’m<a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://uk.linkedin.com/in/colinhoweuk\"> <u>Colin</u></a>, Head of EMEA Engineering. I’ve spent a number of years leading engineering teams in startups, and that has always included being close to infrastructure teams - no matter what name they’ve worn (SRE, infrastructure, platform, etc). I’ve got my hands dirty building the initial infrastructure for startups and know the value a talented infrastructure engineer brings. The rigour, the discipline, the peace and quiet when everything just <em>hums along</em>.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Our infrastructure is in a good place <em>for now</em>. Nothing is static. Ashby continues to grow rapidly, putting strain on our existing infrastructure. We’re always looking to give our customers more powerful hiring software, and building new product features often requires new pieces of infrastructure.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Having herded plenty of <em>snowflakeservers</em> in the past, I’ve learned there’s a better way. I (and Ashby) place a lot of value on code-as-infrastructure. As a Platform Engineer at Ashby, you’ll get to dive into scaling problems, add new capabilities to our platform, and think about how our entire team interacts with infrastructure. All our own engineers own their projects end-to-end and ship with minimal oversight. We don’t put roadblocks to ensure security when common sense will do and we don’t build processes like change management boards around the lowest common denominator. But with great power comes great responsibility: we handle personal and confidential data about some of the biggest decisions we ever make at work. As we grow, more and bigger customers rely on us to be reliable and secure and how we operate internally will need to evolve.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We’re at an inflection point where our ability to scale and deliver a seamless experience has a make-or-break impact – we have some of the fastest growing companies using our platform every day to hire hundreds of people per month. We need someone like you to make good decisions, debug thorny issues, and build us a future-proof platform that can withstand this scale. Our small but mighty infrastructure team has set up a secure and simple environment (we don’t believe in spinning up a new service unless necessary!) for our growing product team to build in. That’s where you come in: you, too, will own projects end-to-end and have an impact on core parts of the Ashby developer and user experience. For instance, you could work on:</p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Optimize <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://www.loom.com/share/32c0cc3eedf2450fb66a901b76186ce4\"><u>our homegrown ultra-dynamic recruiting DSL-to-SQL compiler</u></a>, and create tools to help developers do so</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Create automated guardrails for the security and privacy of our customer data</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Help our developers ship features fast through canary deploys, gradual rollouts and feature flags, while keeping complexity manageable and reducing downtime</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Work with the business and the engineering team to define SLOs and implement the corresponding SLIs.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Ensure all communication with external services supports retries and circuit-breakers.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Implement the infrastructure to support an event-driven architecture and data warehouse.</p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We’re looking for someone who can build systems that an engineer would like to work with: mature and boring but open-minded and approachable. We have to balance reliability with flexibility. Software and its availability are now mission critical to almost every working professional. To be in an SRE in today’s world, you have to be extremely comfortable evaluating risk, those you take and those others take.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1>Why you should or shouldn’t apply</h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You should apply if:</p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You never stop. You get weirdly obsessed about a problem that doesn’t yet make sense, turn it every which way in your head until the explanation dawns. You’ll search every rock, inventory every clue, hunt every mismatch. We do that, too - together we’ll be armed with state-of-the-art monitoring tools and an impressive amount of data, and join you in the adventure.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You don’t take shortcuts. You’re speaking up for the future user, the edge case, the doomsday design. You know product engineers want to build it with you, and see them as allies, where you give them the power and knowledge to access greater things.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You’re someone who cares about what you do and the team you do it with, and want to work with others who do as well. You’ll be on interview panels choosing your next colleagues, and you’ll take that seriously. You only want to work with people who make you better, and want to make you better.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You’ve built infrastructure at a slightly later stage than Ashby is at - you know how to deal with millions of data points, have seen great (or not great) infrastructure make or break customer experience, and have automated everything from provisioning to monitoring and release process.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You’re a Swiss army knife (all nationalities welcome ;) ). You’ll get every hard problem the company faces. You’ll get to do infrastructure updates, security enforcements, database optimization, Kubernetes debugging, and digging through Typescript traces figuring out what doesn’t work. You probably don’t feel like an expert at at least some of that... and that appeals to you.</p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">All that makes for a pretty specific kind of role, and the job isn’t to everyone’s tastes! You should not apply if:</p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You don’t want to make your own decisions on what is the best paved road to build for Ashby, and expect a lead or manager to make the final call on what that is. Our leads (and managers) give ample commentary and feedback on technical decisions and how they’re made, but you ship what you want to build and are accountable for it.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You hate SQL. We have a lot of features built around making the best out of data, and our platform engineers also sometimes dive into a gnarly report or advise engineers on a more performant data model to use.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You don’t want to code. Our SREs are some of our best software engineers and they are just as responsible for the application as the other engineering teams - albeit at a platform level. Reviewing code and submitting code changes will be part of your day to day.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Your primary mode of communicating best practices to engineers is live meetings. We’re a very async culture and written communication (and code) is how changes get made. As an Ashby SRE, you will need to share new tooling and best practices with engineers faster than your next meeting opportunity will take you.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You’ve never delivered a project, on your own, without someone prodding you for updates. We have no project or delivery managers to fill your calendar with busy work, but the flip side is you have to do your project management, seek the help you need to get unstuck and cut scope when it’s worthwhile.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p></li></ul><h1>Technology Stack</h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">I’m sharing our tech stack with the caveat that we don’t require previous experience in it: TypeScript (frontend &amp; backend), Node.js, React, Apollo GraphQL, Postgres, Redis.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We use Datadog and Sentry on 100% cloud-based (AWS) infra. We take developer experience and reliability seriously: all engineers are on call in a follow-the-sun model, and everyone contributes to developer tooling.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1>What We’re Building</h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">As engineers, we are used to tooling that makes us <strong>better</strong> at what we do. When we started Ashby, we saw the opposite with Talent Acquisition software. Recruiting teams were leveling up how they did their work, but instead of software meeting this new standard, it held them back.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Scheduling a final round is an excellent example. Recruiting teams wanted to schedule candidates faster, track interviewer preparation and quality, and do it with half the headcount. A recruiter needed to manually collect availability from the candidate, identify qualified interviewers, perform “Calendar Tetris” to find who is available to interview the candidate, schedule on the earliest date possible, and make any last-minute adjustments as availability changed. They must do this while considering the interview load on each individual and whether interviewers need to be trained and shadowing others. 🥵 TA software didn’t help.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">As hiring managers, we know TA is a critical function, and as engineers, we know software can do better. So, we built and continue to build Ashby to give TA teams the <em>highest</em> standard of tooling. Software that’s intelligent and powerful. Software that provides insights into where they’re failing and automates or simplifies many of the tasks they’re underwater with. We want other functions and departments to be jealous of what TA teams can do with Ashby, and today they often are!</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1>Engineering Culture</h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Our engineering culture is motivated by <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/abhikpramanik/\"><u>Abhik</u></a> and <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/benjaminencz/\"><u>Benji</u></a>’s (our co-founders) belief that a small talented team, given the right environment, can build high-quality software fast (and work regular hours!). We do it through:</p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Minimal process with ownership over decisions normally made by product and design</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Natural collaboration and deliberate communication</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Investing in tools and abstractions that give us leverage</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Putting effort into building a diverse team</p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h2><strong>Minimal Process &amp; Lots of Ownership</strong></h2><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">The best engineers we’ve worked with delivered reliably magical outcomes. They took customer problems and relentlessly drove them to solutions that were not only successful but often brilliant and creative. While they did this with minimal oversight, stakeholders were never in the dark as to what was going on, and no setback was a surprise.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Traditional product-development processes aren’t meant for the best engineers. Their purpose is to create consistent outcomes regardless of the engineer’s skill. But, consistency comes at the expense of an engineer’s time and freedom—both ingredients necessary to generate those magical outcomes. As a result, process stifles the best engineers and doesn’t give others the opportunity to practice the behaviors that made the best engineers the “best.”</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">At Ashby, we want to build an environment that encourages every engineer to be their best. So, at Ashby, every Engineer runs their project. Product Managers (and Designers) build strategy, do customer research, and hand off problem briefs to Engineers. Engineers take on the rest: they research the problem, write product specs, build wireframes, and implement their solution end-to-end. We rely on engineers, not process, to push information outward to the relevant folks (e.g., Product Managers) and pull folks in to help (e.g., Designers, Infra). It’s a new level of ownership for many engineers, but we’d rather an engineer fail a bit and coach up their skills than use process as a crutch. Not everyone succeeds in our culture, but those who do <em>thrive</em>.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h2><strong>Collaboration is Natural &amp; Communication is Deliberate</strong></h2><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Our engineering team consists of lifelong learners who are talented but also humble and kind (meet them <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://www.ashbyhq.com/team\"><u>here</u></a>!). These attributes create an environment where collaboration happens naturally. We combine this with research, prototyping, and written proposals to see around corners and get feedback from the team across time zones. Focus time is something that we hold sacred, and, with thoughtful and deliberate communication, engineers are in &lt;2h meetings per week (Abhik wrote about it <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://www.ashbyhq.com/blog/company/thoughtful-communication\"><u>here</u></a>).</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">To drive it home, here's a recent calendar of an engineer who has been with us for over 4 years:</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><div style=\"text-align:left\"><img style=\"max-width:100%\" src=\"https://app.ashbyhq.com/api/images/user-content/4ea5f68e-c33e-4ac9-831a-e732bee4a303/d4679311-9dba-4031-bf5e-19ce78597ab1/calendar.png\" /></div><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We also meet in person at least twice a year, once as a department and once as a company. You also have a small budget to meet up with folks in your city/region.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h2><strong>Increase Leverage, not Team Size</strong></h2><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We built Ashby with the quality, breadth, and depth that many customers would expect from much larger teams over larger time scales. We’ve done this through investment in:</p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><strong>Great developer tooling.</strong> Our CI/CD takes ~10m, and we deploy at least 15x a day. A debugger that works out of the box. Everyone on the team has contributed to our developer experience 💪🏾.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><strong>Building blocks to create powerful and customizable products fast.</strong> At the core of Ashby is a set of common components (analytics modeling and query language, policy engine, workflow engine, design system) that we constantly improve. Each improvement to a common component cascades throughout our app (short video below).</p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Here’s an impromptu quote from Arjun in our company Slack of what it’s like to build a feature at Ashby:</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><div style=\"text-align:left\"><img style=\"max-width:100%\" src=\"https://app.ashbyhq.com/api/images/user-content/4ea5f68e-c33e-4ac9-831a-e732bee4a303/8d94727a-46d8-42a2-9627-ddcd7f822f95/arjun.png\" /></div><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">And a demo of one of these building blocks:</p><div><div style=\"left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:62.5%\"><iframe src=\"https://embedded-media.ashbyhq.com/embed/4ea5f68e-c33e-4ac9-831a-e732bee4a303/9a5f032d-c731-411e-98cf-261517156f01\" style=\"top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0\" allowfullscreen scrolling=\"no\" allow=\"encrypted-media *; picture-in-picture *;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-presentation\"></iframe></div></div><h2><strong>Put Effort into Diversity</strong></h2><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Diverse teams drive innovation and better outcomes. Having seen my mother and partner build their careers as minority women in non-diverse fields, I want to make sure Ashby creates opportunities for the next generation of engineers from underrepresented groups.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Today, 21% of engineers at Ashby are from underrepresented groups. It’s not great, and we are taking conscious steps to improve, like sourcing diverse candidates, providing generous paid family leave, no leetcode interviews, and more.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1>Interview Process</h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">At Ashby, our team and interview process want to help you show your best self. We’ll dive into past projects and simulate working together via pair programming, writing product and tech specs collaboratively, and talking through decisions. There are no leetcode or whiteboard exercises.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Our interview process is three rounds:</p><ol style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Introduction call with Hiring Manager (15 to 30m, live)</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">A technical screen where we pair in our actual codebase (1h, live)</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Three non-coding interviews that focus on technical design, debugging incidents, and infrastructure (3h 15m, live can be split across multiple days)</p></li></ol><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Depending on our leadership team’s bandwidth, we may start with an <em>additional</em> 30m screen with a recruiter.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Your hiring manager will be your main point of contact and prep you for interviews. Each round will have written guidance so you know what to expect (you’ll need minimal preparation). You’ll meet 4 to 6 people in engineering (with 5-15 minutes in each interview to ask them questions). If we don’t give an offer, we’ll provide feedback!</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1><strong>Your First Three Months at Ashby</strong></h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We want an exceptional onboarding experience for every new hire. At Ashby, your dev environment is set up with a single script, you push your first product change on day one, and you spend the rest of your time shipping product changes that give you a tour of our codebase and best practices. The product changes increase in scope and ambiguity from simple copy changes to the delivery of a prominent, impactful feature.

            "descriptionPlain": "We’re looking for a curious, rigorous, problem-hungry platform engineer (who codes!) to carry the ball as we bring Ashby to the big leagues. Ashby builds software that lets talent teams build an efficient, delightful, respectful hiring process. Similarly, you’re an engineer who wants to build a “paved road” that excellent engineering teams can safely take to the moon and back.\n\nWe have notable customers like Notion, Linear, Shopify, and Snowflake. Our growth and retention metrics are best-in-class among our peers: we have tens of millions in ARR, growing >100% year over year, over 2500 customers, very low churn, and many years of runway. We’ll share more details once we meet, but you now probably have a good idea as to why we're hiring for this role 😅.\n\nWe’ve listed this role twice: as a Platform Engineer and Site Reliability Engineer – our team does both, and we are open to candidates who lean towards one or the other.\n\n\nABOUT THE ROLE AND HOW WE WORK\n\nHi 👋 I’m Colin https://uk.linkedin.com/in/colinhoweuk, Head of EMEA Engineering. I’ve spent a number of years leading engineering teams in startups, and that has always included being close to infrastructure teams - no matter what name they’ve worn (SRE, infrastructure, platform, etc). I’ve got my hands dirty building the initial infrastructure for startups and know the value a talented infrastructure engineer brings. The rigour, the discipline, the peace and quiet when everything just hums along.\n\nOur infrastructure is in a good place for now. Nothing is static. Ashby continues to grow rapidly, putting strain on our existing infrastructure. We’re always looking to give our customers more powerful hiring software, and building new product features often requires new pieces of infrastructure.\n\nHaving herded plenty of snowflakeservers in the past, I’ve learned there’s a better way. I (and Ashby) place a lot of value on code-as-infrastructure. As a Platform Engineer at Ashby, you’ll get to dive into scaling problems, add new capabilities to our platform, and think about how our entire team interacts with infrastructure. All our own engineers own their projects end-to-end and ship with minimal oversight. We don’t put roadblocks to ensure security when common sense will do and we don’t build processes like change management boards around the lowest common denominator. But with great power comes great responsibility: we handle personal and confidential data about some of the biggest decisions we ever make at work. As we grow, more and bigger customers rely on us to be reliable and secure and how we operate internally will need to evolve.\n\nWe’re at an inflection point where our ability to scale and deliver a seamless experience has a make-or-break impact – we have some of the fastest growing companies using our platform every day to hire hundreds of people per month. We need someone like you to make good decisions, debug thorny issues, and build us a future-proof platform that can withstand this scale. Our small but mighty infrastructure team has set up a secure and simple environment (we don’t believe in spinning up a new service unless necessary!) for our growing product team to build in. That’s where you come in: you, too, will own projects end-to-end and have an impact on core parts of the Ashby developer and user experience. For instance, you could work on:\n\n - Optimize our homegrown ultra-dynamic recruiting DSL-to-SQL compiler https://www.loom.com/share/32c0cc3eedf2450fb66a901b76186ce4, and create tools to help developers do so\n\n - Create automated guardrails for the security and privacy of our customer data\n\n - Help our developers ship features fast through canary deploys, gradual rollouts and feature flags, while keeping complexity manageable and reducing downtime\n\n - Work with the business and the engineering team to define SLOs and implement the corresponding SLIs.\n\n - Ensure all communication with external services supports retries and circuit-breakers.\n\n - Implement the infrastructure to support an event-driven architecture and data warehouse.\n\nWe’re looking for someone who can build systems that an engineer would like to work with: mature and boring but open-minded and approachable. We have to balance reliability with flexibility. Software and its availability are now mission critical to almost every working professional. To be in an SRE in today’s world, you have to be extremely comfortable evaluating risk, those you take and those others take.\n\n\nWHY YOU SHOULD OR SHOULDN’T APPLY\n\nYou should apply if:\n\n - You never stop. You get weirdly obsessed about a problem that doesn’t yet make sense, turn it every which way in your head until the explanation dawns. You’ll search every rock, inventory every clue, hunt every mismatch. We do that, too - together we’ll be armed with state-of-the-art monitoring tools and an impressive amount of data, and join you in the adventure.\n\n - You don’t take shortcuts. You’re speaking up for the future user, the edge case, the doomsday design. You know product engineers want to build it with you, and see them as allies, where you give them the power and knowledge to access greater things.\n\n - You’re someone who cares about what you do and the team you do it with, and want to work with others who do as well. You’ll be on interview panels choosing your next colleagues, and you’ll take that seriously. You only want to work with people who make you better, and want to make you better.\n\n - You’ve built infrastructure at a slightly later stage than Ashby is at - you know how to deal with millions of data points, have seen great (or not great) infrastructure make or break customer experience, and have automated everything from provisioning to monitoring and release process.\n\n - You’re a Swiss army knife (all nationalities welcome ;) ). You’ll get every hard problem the company faces. You’ll get to do infrastructure updates, security enforcements, database optimization, Kubernetes debugging, and digging through Typescript traces figuring out what doesn’t work. You probably don’t feel like an expert at at least some of that... and that appeals to you.\n\nAll that makes for a pretty specific kind of role, and the job isn’t to everyone’s tastes! You should not apply if:\n\n - You don’t want to make your own decisions on what is the best paved road to build for Ashby, and expect a lead or manager to make the final call on what that is. Our leads (and managers) give ample commentary and feedback on technical decisions and how they’re made, but you ship what you want to build and are accountable for it.\n\n - You hate SQL. We have a lot of features built around making the best out of data, and our platform engineers also sometimes dive into a gnarly report or advise engineers on a more performant data model to use.\n\n - You don’t want to code. Our SREs are some of our best software engineers and they are just as responsible for the application as the other engineering teams - albeit at a platform level. Reviewing code and submitting code changes will be part of your day to day.\n\n - Your primary mode of communicating best practices to engineers is live meetings. We’re a very async culture and written communication (and code) is how changes get made. As an Ashby SRE, you will need to share new tooling and best practices with engineers faster than your next meeting opportunity will take you.\n\n - You’ve never delivered a project, on your own, without someone prodding you for updates. We have no project or delivery managers to fill your calendar with busy work, but the flip side is you have to do your project management, seek the help you need to get unstuck and cut scope when it’s worthwhile.\n\n\nTECHNOLOGY STACK\n\nI’m sharing our tech stack with the caveat that we don’t require previous experience in it: TypeScript (frontend & backend), Node.js, React, Apollo GraphQL, Postgres, Redis.\n\nWe use Datadog and Sentry on 100% cloud-based (AWS) infra. We take developer experience and reliability seriously: all engineers are on call in a follow-the-sun model, and everyone contributes to developer tooling.\n\n\nWHAT WE’RE BUILDING\n\nAs engineers, we are used to tooling that makes us better at what we do. When we started Ashby, we saw the opposite with Talent Acquisition software. Recruiting teams were leveling up how they did their work, but instead of software meeting this new standard, it held them back.\n\nScheduling a final round is an excellent example. Recruiting teams wanted to schedule candidates faster, track interviewer preparation and quality, and do it with half the headcount. A recruiter needed to manually collect availability from the candidate, identify qualified interviewers, perform “Calendar Tetris” to find who is available to interview the candidate, schedule on the earliest date possible, and make any last-minute adjustments as availability changed. They must do this while considering the interview load on each individual and whether interviewers need to be trained and shadowing others. 🥵 TA software didn’t help.\n\nAs hiring managers, we know TA is a critical function, and as engineers, we know software can do better. So, we built and continue to build Ashby to give TA teams the highest standard of tooling. Software that’s intelligent and powerful. Software that provides insights into where they’re failing and automates or simplifies many of the tasks they’re underwater with. We want other functions and departments to be jealous of what TA teams can do with Ashby, and today they often are!\n\n\nENGINEERING CULTURE\n\nOur engineering culture is motivated by Abhik https://www.linkedin.com/in/abhikpramanik/ and Benji https://www.linkedin.com/in/benjaminencz/’s (our co-founders) belief that a small talented team, given the right environment, can build high-quality software fast (and work regular hours!). We do it through:\n\n - Minimal process with ownership over decisions normally made by product and design\n\n - Natural collaboration and deliberate communication\n\n - Investing in tools and abstractions that give us leverage\n\n - Putting effort into building a diverse team\n\n\nMINIMAL PROCESS & LOTS OF OWNERSHIP\n\nThe best engineers we’ve worked with delivered reliably magical outcomes. They took customer problems and relentlessly drove them to solutions that were not only successful but often brilliant and creative. While they did this with minimal oversight, stakeholders were never in the dark as to what was going on, and no setback was a surprise.\n\nTraditional product-development processes aren’t meant for the best engineers. Their purpose is to create consistent outcomes regardless of the engineer’s skill. But, consistency comes at the expense of an engineer’s time and freedom—both ingredients necessary to generate those magical outcomes. As a result, process stifles the best engineers and doesn’t give others the opportunity to practice the behaviors that made the best engineers the “best.”\n\nAt Ashby, we want to build an environment that encourages every engineer to be their best. So, at Ashby, every Engineer runs their project. Product Managers (and Designers) build strategy, do customer research, and hand off problem briefs to Engineers. Engineers take on the rest: they research the problem, write product specs, build wireframes, and implement their solution end-to-end. We rely on engineers, not process, to push information outward to the relevant folks (e.g., Product Managers) and pull folks in to help (e.g., Designers, Infra). It’s a new level of ownership for many engineers, but we’d rather an engineer fail a bit and coach up their skills than use process as a crutch. Not everyone succeeds in our culture, but those who do thrive.\n\n\nCOLLABORATION IS NATURAL & COMMUNICATION IS DELIBERATE\n\nOur engineering team consists of lifelong learners who are talented but also humble and kind (meet them here https://www.ashbyhq.com/team!). These attributes create an environment where collaboration happens naturally. We combine this with research, prototyping, and written proposals to see around corners and get feedback from the team across time zones. Focus time is something that we hold sacred, and, with thoughtful and deliberate communication, engineers are in <2h meetings per week (Abhik wrote about it here https://www.ashbyhq.com/blog/company/thoughtful-communication).\n\nTo drive it home, here's a recent calendar of an engineer who has been with us for over 4 years:\n\n[https://app.ashbyhq.com/api/images/user-content/4ea5f68e-c33e-4ac9-831a-e732bee4a303/d4679311-9dba-4031-bf5e-19ce78597ab1/calendar.png]\n\nWe also meet in person at least twice a year, once as a department and once as a company. You also have a small budget to meet up with folks in your city/region.\n\n\nINCREASE LEVERAGE, NOT TEAM SIZE\n\nWe built Ashby with the quality, breadth, and depth that many customers would expect from much larger teams over larger time scales. We’ve done this through investment in:\n\n - Great developer tooling. Our CI/CD takes ~10m, and we deploy at least 15x a day. A debugger that works out of the box. Everyone on the team has contributed to our developer experience 💪🏾.\n\n - Building blocks to create powerful and customizable products fast. At the core of Ashby is a set of common components (analytics modeling and query language, policy engine, workflow engine, design system) that we constantly improve. Each improvement to a common component cascades throughout our app (short video below).\n\nHere’s an impromptu quote from Arjun in our company Slack of what it’s like to build a feature at Ashby:\n\n[https://app.ashbyhq.com/api/images/user-content/4ea5f68e-c33e-4ac9-831a-e732bee4a303/8d94727a-46d8-42a2-9627-ddcd7f822f95/arjun.png]\n\nAnd a demo of one of these building blocks:\n\n\nPUT EFFORT INTO DIVERSITY\n\nDiverse teams drive innovation and better outcomes. Having seen my mother and partner build their careers as minority women in non-diverse fields, I want to make sure Ashby creates opportunities for the next generation of engineers from underrepresented groups.\n\nToday, 21% of engineers at Ashby are from underrepresented groups. It’s not great, and we are taking conscious steps to improve, like sourcing diverse candidates, providing generous paid family leave, no leetcode interviews, and more.\n\n\nINTERVIEW PROCESS\n\nAt Ashby, our team and interview process want to help you show your best self. We’ll dive into past projects and simulate working together via pair programming, writing product and tech specs collaboratively, and talking through decisions. There are no leetcode or whiteboard exercises.\n\nOur interview process is three rounds:\n\n 1. Introduction call with Hiring Manager (15 to 30m, live)\n\n 2. A technical screen where we pair in our actual codebase (1h, live)\n\n 3. Three non-coding interviews that focus on technical design, debugging incidents, and infrastructure (3h 15m, live can be split across multiple days)\n\nDepending on our leadership team’s bandwidth, we may start with an additional 30m screen with a recruiter.\n\nYour hiring manager will be your main point of contact and prep you for interviews. Each round will have written guidance so you know what to expect (you’ll need minimal preparation). You’ll meet 4 to 6 people in engineering (with 5-15 minutes in each interview to ask them questions). If we don’t give an offer, we’ll provide feedback!\n\n\nYOUR FIRST THREE MONTHS AT ASHBY\n\nWe want an exceptional onboarding experience for every new hire. At Ashby, your dev environment is set up with a single script, you push your first product change on day one, and you spend the rest of your time shipping product changes that give you a tour of our codebase and best practices. The product changes increase in scope and ambiguity from simple copy changes to the delivery of a prominent, impactful feature. Your manager will do a 30, 60, and 90-day review to give feedback and calibrate on how we work together.\n\nIt’s a team effort to get you successfully onboarded; you’ll have a peer paired with you to answer questions, pair program, and check in often to see if you need help. The rest of the team will run training sessions on our culture, product, engineering process, and technical architecture.\n\n\nBENEFITS\n\n - Competitive salary and equity.\n\n - 10-year exercise window for stock options. You shouldn’t feel pressure to purchase stock options if you leave Ashby —do it when you feel financially comfortable.\n\n - Unlimited PTO, and we will encourage you to take it.\n\n - A minimum of 12 weeks of fully paid parental leave, covered by Ashby. For folks outside the US, it may be longer to be in line with regional requirements.\n\n - Generous equipment, software, and office furniture budget. Get what you need to be happy and productive!\n\n - $100/month education budget with more expensive items (like conferences) covered with manager approval.\n\n - If you’re in the US, we offer top-tier health insurance for you and your dependents, with 100% of premiums covered by Ashby. In other countries, we provide high-quality supplemental health insurance for you and your dependents, also fully covered by us.\n\nAshby’s success hinges on hiring great people and creating an environment where we can be happy, feel challenged, and do our best work. We’re being deliberate about building that environment from the ground up. I hope that excites you enough to apply.\n\nAshby provides equal employment opportunities (EEO) to all employees and applicants for employment without regard to race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability, genetics, sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression. We are committed to a diverse and inclusive workforce and welcome people from all backgrounds, experiences, perspectives, and abilities.",

            "descriptionHtml": "<p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Hi 👋🏾 I’m <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/abhikpramanik/\"><u>Abhik</u></a>, Ashby's Co-Founder and VP of Engineering. As someone who could design and build software, this position is close to my heart. I always felt I had a unique perspective because I could play with design ideas and iterate <em>in code</em>. My ideas could start in Figma but then be grounded (or sometimes more creative) in code. My prototypes used actual logic and data. My changes cascaded throughout the app for comprehensive critique (thanks, React component system!). But, every company made me pick one —I couldn’t design <em>and </em>build. At Ashby, you can.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">While every engineer can design <em>and </em>build, you’ll tackle our most challenging design problems and help others improve their designs by expanding and enhancing our in-house design system and consulting on bespoke work. To ground it with examples, engineers who can design at Ashby have:</p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Redesigned our mobile web app by talking with customers who use it often, wireframing new flows, implementing its design system, and using it to make the wireframes a reality.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Built a set of flexible, composable components in our design system that allow other engineers to build custom autocompletes. These autocompletes can contain filters, options to create new records, etc.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Helped another engineer improve their design's information hierarchy and scannability for viewing a candidate’s assessments. Recruiters can quickly parse information and pick out anomalies.</p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">These projects reflect what we’re accomplishing at Ashby: improving the productivity of working professionals (starting with talent teams) with intelligent and powerful software. We put a lot of effort into designing products that are approachable to beginners but mastered &amp; extended by power users. In many ways, spreadsheets set the bar here.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We have notable customers like Notion, Linear, Shopify, and Snowflake. Our growth and retention metrics are best-in-class among our peers: we have tens of millions in ARR, growing &gt;100% year over year, over 2500 customers, very low churn, and many years of runway. We’ll share more details once we meet, but you now probably have a good idea as to why we're hiring for this role 😅.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1>What We’re Building</h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">As engineers, we are used to tooling that makes us <strong>better</strong> at what we do. When we started Ashby, we saw the opposite with Talent Acquisition software. Recruiting teams were leveling up how they did their work, but instead of software meeting this new standard, it held them back.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Scheduling a final round is an excellent example. Recruiting teams wanted to schedule candidates faster, track interviewer preparation and quality, and do it with half the headcount. A recruiter needed to manually collect availability from the candidate, identify qualified interviewers, perform “Calendar Tetris” to find who is available to interview the candidate, schedule on the earliest date possible, and make any last-minute adjustments as availability changed. They must do this while considering the interview load on each individual and whether interviewers need to be trained and shadowing others. 🥵 TA software didn’t help.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">As hiring managers, we know TA is a critical function, and as engineers, we know software can do better. So, we built and continue to build Ashby to give TA teams the <em>highest</em> standard of tooling. Software that’s intelligent and powerful. Software that provides insights into where they’re failing and automates or simplifies many of the tasks they’re underwater with. We want other functions and departments to be jealous of what TA teams can do with Ashby, and today they often are!</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1>Engineering Culture</h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Our engineering culture is motivated by Benji’s (my Co-founder and CEO) and my belief that a small, talented team, given the right environment, can build high-quality software fast (and work regular hours!). We do it through:</p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Minimal process with ownership over decisions normally made by product and design</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Natural collaboration and deliberate communication</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Investing in tools and abstractions that give us leverage</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Putting effort into building a diverse team</p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h2><strong>Minimal Process &amp; Lots of Ownership</strong></h2><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">The best engineers we’ve worked with delivered reliably magical outcomes. They took customer problems and relentlessly drove them to solutions that were not only successful but often brilliant and creative. While they did this with minimal oversight, stakeholders were never in the dark as to what was going on, and no setback was a surprise.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Traditional product-development processes aren’t meant for the best engineers. Their purpose is to create consistent outcomes regardless of the engineer’s skill. But, consistency comes at the expense of an engineer’s time and freedom—both ingredients necessary to generate those magical outcomes. As a result, process stifles the best engineers and doesn’t give others the opportunity to practice the behaviors that made the best engineers the “best.”</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">At Ashby, we want to build an environment that encourages every engineer to be their best. So, at Ashby, every Engineer runs their project. Product Managers (and Designers) build strategy, do customer research, and hand off problem briefs to Engineers. Engineers take on the rest: they research the problem, write product specs, build wireframes, and implement their solution end-to-end. We rely on engineers, not process, to push information outward to the relevant folks (e.g., Product Managers) and pull folks in to help (e.g., Designers, Infra). It’s a new level of ownership for many engineers, but we’d rather an engineer fail a bit and coach up their skills than use process as a crutch. Not everyone succeeds in our culture, but those who do <em>thrive</em>.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h2><strong>Collaboration is Natural &amp; Communication is Deliberate</strong></h2><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Our engineering team consists of lifelong learners who are talented but also humble and kind (meet them <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://www.ashbyhq.com/team\"><u>here</u></a>!). These attributes create an environment where collaboration happens naturally. We combine this with research, prototyping, and written proposals to see around corners and get feedback from the team across time zones. Focus time is something that we hold sacred, and, with thoughtful and deliberate communication, engineers are in &lt;2h meetings per week (I wrote about it <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://www.ashbyhq.com/blog/company/thoughtful-communication\"><u>here</u></a>).</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">To drive it home, here's a recent calendar of an engineer who has been with us for over 4 years:</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><div style=\"text-align:left\"><img style=\"max-width:100%\" src=\"https://app.ashbyhq.com/api/images/user-content/4ea5f68e-c33e-4ac9-831a-e732bee4a303/d4679311-9dba-4031-bf5e-19ce78597ab1/calendar.png\" /></div><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We also meet in person at least twice a year, once as a department and once as a company. You also have a small budget to meet up with folks in your city/region.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h2><strong>Increase Leverage, not Team Size</strong></h2><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We built Ashby with the quality, breadth, and depth that many customers would expect from much larger teams over larger time scales. We’ve done this through investment in:</p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><strong>Great developer tooling.</strong> Our CI/CD takes ~10m, and we deploy at least 15x a day. A debugger that works out of the box. Everyone on the team has contributed to our developer experience 💪🏾.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><strong>Building blocks to create powerful and customizable products fast.</strong> At the core of Ashby is a set of common components (analytics modeling and query language, policy engine, workflow engine, design system) that we constantly improve. Each improvement to a common component cascades throughout our app (short video below).</p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Here’s an impromptu quote from Arjun in our company Slack of what it’s like to build a feature at Ashby:</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><div style=\"text-align:left\"><img style=\"max-width:100%\" src=\"https://app.ashbyhq.com/api/images/user-content/4ea5f68e-c33e-4ac9-831a-e732bee4a303/8d94727a-46d8-42a2-9627-ddcd7f822f95/arjun.png\" /></div><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">And a demo of one of these building blocks:</p><div><div style=\"left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:62.5%\"><iframe src=\"https://embedded-media.ashbyhq.com/embed/4ea5f68e-c33e-4ac9-831a-e732bee4a303/9a5f032d-c731-411e-98cf-261517156f01\" style=\"top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0\" allowfullscreen scrolling=\"no\" allow=\"encrypted-media *; picture-in-picture *;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-presentation\"></iframe></div></div><h2><strong>Put Effort into Diversity</strong></h2><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Diverse teams drive innovation and better outcomes. Having seen my mother and partner build their careers as minority women in non-diverse fields, I want to make sure Ashby creates opportunities for the next generation of engineers from underrepresented groups.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Today, 21% of engineers at Ashby are from underrepresented groups. It’s not great, and we are taking conscious steps to improve, like sourcing diverse candidates, providing generous paid family leave, no leetcode interviews, and more.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1><strong>Interview Process</strong></h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">At Ashby, our team and interview process want to help you show your best self. We’ll dive into past projects and simulate working together via pair programming, writing product and tech specs collaboratively, and talking through decisions. There are no leetcode or whiteboard exercises.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Our interview process is three rounds:</p><ol style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Introduction call with Hiring Manager (15 to 30m, live)</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">A technical screen where we pair in our actual codebase (1h, live)</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Three non-coding interviews that focus on product thinking, technical design, and infrastructure (3h 15m, live can be split across multiple days)</p></li></ol><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Depending on our leadership team’s bandwidth, we may start with an <em>additional</em> 30m screen with a recruiter.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Your hiring manager will be your main point of contact and prep you for interviews. Each round will have written guidance so you know what to expect (you’ll need minimal preparation). You’ll meet 4 to 6 people in engineering (with 5-15 minutes in each interview to ask them questions). If we don’t give an offer, we’ll provide feedback!</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h1><strong>Your First Three Months at Ashby</strong></h1><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We want an exceptional onboarding experience for every new hire. At Ashby, your dev environment is set up with a single script, you push your first product change on day one, and you spend the rest of your time shipping product changes that give you a tour of our codebase and best practices.

            "descriptionPlain": "Hi 👋🏾 I’m Abhik https://www.linkedin.com/in/abhikpramanik/, Ashby's Co-Founder and VP of Engineering. As someone who could design and build software, this position is close to my heart. I always felt I had a unique perspective because I could play with design ideas and iterate in code. My ideas could start in Figma but then be grounded (or sometimes more creative) in code. My prototypes used actual logic and data. My changes cascaded throughout the app for comprehensive critique (thanks, React component system!). But, every company made me pick one —I couldn’t design and build. At Ashby, you can.\n\nWhile every engineer can design and build, you’ll tackle our most challenging design problems and help others improve their designs by expanding and enhancing our in-house design system and consulting on bespoke work. To ground it with examples, engineers who can design at Ashby have:\n\n - Redesigned our mobile web app by talking with customers who use it often, wireframing new flows, implementing its design system, and using it to make the wireframes a reality.\n\n - Built a set of flexible, composable components in our design system that allow other engineers to build custom autocompletes. These autocompletes can contain filters, options to create new records, etc.\n\n - Helped another engineer improve their design's information hierarchy and scannability for viewing a candidate’s assessments. Recruiters can quickly parse information and pick out anomalies.\n\nThese projects reflect what we’re accomplishing at Ashby: improving the productivity of working professionals (starting with talent teams) with intelligent and powerful software. We put a lot of effort into designing products that are approachable to beginners but mastered & extended by power users. In many ways, spreadsheets set the bar here.\n\nWe have notable customers like Notion, Linear, Shopify, and Snowflake. Our growth and retention metrics are best-in-class among our peers: we have tens of millions in ARR, growing >100% year over year, over 2500 customers, very low churn, and many years of runway. We’ll share more details once we meet, but you now probably have a good idea as to why we're hiring for this role 😅.\n\n\nWHAT WE’RE BUILDING\n\nAs engineers, we are used to tooling that makes us better at what we do. When we started Ashby, we saw the opposite with Talent Acquisition software. Recruiting teams were leveling up how they did their work, but instead of software meeting this new standard, it held them back.\n\nScheduling a final round is an excellent example. Recruiting teams wanted to schedule candidates faster, track interviewer preparation and quality, and do it with half the headcount. A recruiter needed to manually collect availability from the candidate, identify qualified interviewers, perform “Calendar Tetris” to find who is available to interview the candidate, schedule on the earliest date possible, and make any last-minute adjustments as availability changed. They must do this while considering the interview load on each individual and whether interviewers need to be trained and shadowing others. 🥵 TA software didn’t help.\n\nAs hiring managers, we know TA is a critical function, and as engineers, we know software can do better. So, we built and continue to build Ashby to give TA teams the highest standard of tooling. Software that’s intelligent and powerful. Software that provides insights into where they’re failing and automates or simplifies many of the tasks they’re underwater with. We want other functions and departments to be jealous of what TA teams can do with Ashby, and today they often are!\n\n\nENGINEERING CULTURE\n\nOur engineering culture is motivated by Benji’s (my Co-founder and CEO) and my belief that a small, talented team, given the right environment, can build high-quality software fast (and work regular hours!). We do it through:\n\n - Minimal process with ownership over decisions normally made by product and design\n\n - Natural collaboration and deliberate communication\n\n - Investing in tools and abstractions that give us leverage\n\n - Putting effort into building a diverse team\n\n\nMINIMAL PROCESS & LOTS OF OWNERSHIP\n\nThe best engineers we’ve worked with delivered reliably magical outcomes. They took customer problems and relentlessly drove them to solutions that were not only successful but often brilliant and creative. While they did this with minimal oversight, stakeholders were never in the dark as to what was going on, and no setback was a surprise.\n\nTraditional product-development processes aren’t meant for the best engineers. Their purpose is to create consistent outcomes regardless of the engineer’s skill. But, consistency comes at the expense of an engineer’s time and freedom—both ingredients necessary to generate those magical outcomes. As a result, process stifles the best engineers and doesn’t give others the opportunity to practice the behaviors that made the best engineers the “best.”\n\nAt Ashby, we want to build an environment that encourages every engineer to be their best. So, at Ashby, every Engineer runs their project. Product Managers (and Designers) build strategy, do customer research, and hand off problem briefs to Engineers. Engineers take on the rest: they research the problem, write product specs, build wireframes, and implement their solution end-to-end. We rely on engineers, not process, to push information outward to the relevant folks (e.g., Product Managers) and pull folks in to help (e.g., Designers, Infra). It’s a new level of ownership for many engineers, but we’d rather an engineer fail a bit and coach up their skills than use process as a crutch. Not everyone succeeds in our culture, but those who do thrive.\n\n\nCOLLABORATION IS NATURAL & COMMUNICATION IS DELIBERATE\n\nOur engineering team consists of lifelong learners who are talented but also humble and kind (meet them here https://www.ashbyhq.com/team!). These attributes create an environment where collaboration happens naturally. We combine this with research, prototyping, and written proposals to see around corners and get feedback from the team across time zones. Focus time is something that we hold sacred, and, with thoughtful and deliberate communication, engineers are in <2h meetings per week (I wrote about it here https://www.ashbyhq.com/blog/company/thoughtful-communication).\n\nTo drive it home, here's a recent calendar of an engineer who has been with us for over 4 years:\n\n[https://app.ashbyhq.com/api/images/user-content/4ea5f68e-c33e-4ac9-831a-e732bee4a303/d4679311-9dba-4031-bf5e-19ce78597ab1/calendar.png]\n\nWe also meet in person at least twice a year, once as a department and once as a company. You also have a small budget to meet up with folks in your city/region.\n\n\nINCREASE LEVERAGE, NOT TEAM SIZE\n\nWe built Ashby with the quality, breadth, and depth that many customers would expect from much larger teams over larger time scales. We’ve done this through investment in:\n\n - Great developer tooling. Our CI/CD takes ~10m, and we deploy at least 15x a day. A debugger that works out of the box. Everyone on the team has contributed to our developer experience 💪🏾.\n\n - Building blocks to create powerful and customizable products fast. At the core of Ashby is a set of common components (analytics modeling and query language, policy engine, workflow engine, design system) that we constantly improve. Each improvement to a common component cascades throughout our app (short video below).\n\nHere’s an impromptu quote from Arjun in our company Slack of what it’s like to build a feature at Ashby:\n\n[https://app.ashbyhq.com/api/images/user-content/4ea5f68e-c33e-4ac9-831a-e732bee4a303/8d94727a-46d8-42a2-9627-ddcd7f822f95/arjun.png]\n\nAnd a demo of one of these building blocks:\n\n\nPUT EFFORT INTO DIVERSITY\n\nDiverse teams drive innovation and better outcomes. Having seen my mother and partner build their careers as minority women in non-diverse fields, I want to make sure Ashby creates opportunities for the next generation of engineers from underrepresented groups.\n\nToday, 21% of engineers at Ashby are from underrepresented groups. It’s not great, and we are taking conscious steps to improve, like sourcing diverse candidates, providing generous paid family leave, no leetcode interviews, and more.\n\n\nINTERVIEW PROCESS\n\nAt Ashby, our team and interview process want to help you show your best self. We’ll dive into past projects and simulate working together via pair programming, writing product and tech specs collaboratively, and talking through decisions. There are no leetcode or whiteboard exercises.\n\nOur interview process is three rounds:\n\n 1. Introduction call with Hiring Manager (15 to 30m, live)\n\n 2. A technical screen where we pair in our actual codebase (1h, live)\n\n 3. Three non-coding interviews that focus on product thinking, technical design, and infrastructure (3h 15m, live can be split across multiple days)\n\nDepending on our leadership team’s bandwidth, we may start with an additional 30m screen with a recruiter.\n\nYour hiring manager will be your main point of contact and prep you for interviews. Each round will have written guidance so you know what to expect (you’ll need minimal preparation). You’ll meet 4 to 6 people in engineering (with 5-15 minutes in each interview to ask them questions). If we don’t give an offer, we’ll provide feedback!\n\n\nYOUR FIRST THREE MONTHS AT ASHBY\n\nWe want an exceptional onboarding experience for every new hire. At Ashby, your dev environment is set up with a single script, you push your first product change on day one, and you spend the rest of your time shipping product changes that give you a tour of our codebase and best practices. The product changes increase in scope and ambiguity from simple copy changes to the delivery of a prominent, impactful feature. Your manager will do a 30, 60, and 90-day review to give feedback and calibrate on how we work together.\n\nIt’s a team effort to get you successfully onboarded; you’ll have a peer paired with you to answer questions, pair program, and check in often to see if you need help. The rest of the team will run training sessions on our culture, product, engineering process, and technical architecture.\n\n\nTECHNOLOGY STACK\n\nI’m sharing our tech stack with the caveat that we don’t require previous experience in it (but a love of typed languages is helpful 😀): TypeScript (frontend & backend), React, GraphQL API, Node.js, Postgres, Redis.\n\nWhen they joined Ashby, many of our engineers switched from other languages like Swift and Kotlin (Ben https://linkedin.com/in/benasher44/), platforms like iOS (Tom https://www.linkedin.com/in/tom-quist-0925a199/) and Windows (Sergey https://www.linkedin.com/in/sergeygalich/). We care more about fundamentals (e.g., debugging, abstractions) and how fast you learn. For folks on the team who switched, it's nice seeing changes hot reload versus waiting for XCode to compile 😅.\n\n\nBENEFITS\n\n - Competitive salary and equity.\n\n - 10-year exercise window for stock options. You shouldn’t feel pressure to purchase stock options if you leave Ashby —do it when you feel financially comfortable.\n\n - Unlimited PTO, and we will encourage you to take it.\n\n - A minimum of 12 weeks of fully paid parental leave, covered by Ashby. For folks outside the US, it may be longer to be in line with regional requirements.\n\n - Generous equipment, software, and office furniture budget. Get what you need to be happy and productive!\n\n - $100/month education budget with more expensive items (like conferences) covered with manager approval.\n\n - If you’re in the US, we offer top-tier health insurance for you and your dependents, with 100% of premiums covered by Ashby. In other countries, we provide high-quality supplemental health insurance for you and your dependents, also fully covered by us.\n\nAshby’s success hinges on hiring great people and creating an environment where we can be happy, feel challenged, and do our best work. We’re being deliberate about building that environment from the ground up. I hope that excites you enough to apply.\n\nAshby provides equal employment opportunities (EEO) to all employees and applicants for employment without regard to race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability, genetics, sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression.

You will play a pivotal role in developing and, with your team, executing programs that foster excellence in our Sales and CS organizations. Success in this hands-on leadership role is measured by the overall effectiveness of our customer-facing Sales &amp; CS teams — this includes but isn’t limited to: fast time-to-ramp for new hires, consistent adoption of our frameworks and methodologies, strategic business partnership with GTM leadership and ultimately delightful customer experiences that drive growth.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">In 2026, Revenue Enablement will be a team of three. You will lead and manage two practitioners, one for each Sales and Customer Success. You will operate in a player-coach capacity, with an eagerness to roll up your sleeves to support program delivery and ensure execution against company priorities. Sales &amp; CS will be close to 200 people by the end of next year, and so you and your team will have a high impact role on Ashby’s growth trajectory to $100M ARR and well beyond.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><h2>Role Scope &amp; Requirements</h2><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><strong>🤝 Business Partnership: </strong>You are innately curious about the work and priorities of our Sales and CS Leaders. You ask the hard questions to understand the nuances of the business to identify how you can have the greatest impact. You partner effectively with stakeholders including Product Marketing, Revenue Operations and Senior Leadership to deliver comprehensive programs in support of our go-to-market strategy.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><strong>⚙️ Program Development &amp; Iteration: </strong>You understand business needs and identify gaps in knowledge or skills. You’re a quick learner who is at home creating and curating materials for go-to-market teams. You collect disparate information through quantitative and qualitative approaches (e.g. interviews, internal documentation, and recorded customer calls) to create tailored learning paths that drive behavior change. You have a track record of proactively eliciting feedback for program improvement and use that, along with performance data and business outcomes, to iterate, refine and scale programs that deliver measurable impact.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><strong>🧑‍🏫 New Hire Onboarding: </strong>You have experience developing onboarding programs for GTM teams that ensure new hires ramp quickly. You have a knack for simplification and prioritization—sometimes less is more. You can be the master architect for role and segment specific onboarding tracks.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><strong>💻 Systems: </strong>You’ve managed an LMS and have perspective on which software capabilities best support learning outcomes and in-field execution. You closely follow AI-native enablement vendors and can separate marketing fluff from powerful new features.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><strong>🚀 Scaling: </strong>You’ve helped a SaaS company scale to over $100M ARR where you lead an enablement team. You thrive in a high growth, dynamic environment and are familiar with reinforcement learning techniques to support organizations of this scale.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><strong>📈 Impact: </strong>You use both analytics and observations to assess the impact of your enablement programs.<strong> </strong>You have a proven track record of achieving measurable improvements in team performance and productivity. You iterate on your approach based on results, evolving company goals, and changing market conditions.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><strong>👷 Team Management:</strong> You are highly organized and have managed a small but mighty enablement team who deliver multiple projects concurrently. You’re an “in the details” leader who ensures the success of your team’s work. You know when to advocate for additional resources to maximize impact.</p></li></ul><h2>Out of Scope</h2><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Since every organization thinks about Revenue Enablement a little bit differently, we intend to be clear about what we currently view as out of scope for this role, while also acknowledging that things may evolve, and your perspective also counts.</p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><strong>Technical Enablement / Ashby Product:</strong> We have an expansive product surface area as a full-suite talent acquisition platform. Our Support, CS and Solutions Engineering teams especially need to develop deep product acumen to be effective in their jobs. We anticipate you being a partner to other owners of Technical Enablement but it is not your primary responsibility.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><strong>Competitive Intelligence:</strong> You would not be expected to become the subject matter expert on our competitive landscape, but would partner with our PMM and Solutions Engineering teams on the creation of competitive enablement programs, leveraging existing knowledge and frameworks.</p></li></ul><h2>You Might Love This Role If</h2><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You have a desire to build a world-class GTM practice.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You’re a systems thinker with experience scaling enablement programs.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Your peers would describe you as operationally excellent.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You excel in cross-functional collaboration.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You have strong opinions on hiring and org design for Enablement</p></li></ul><h2>This Role Might Not Be for You If</h2><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You are uncomfortable rolling up your sleeves and executing. You will be extremely hands-on in this role, this is not a role for delegators.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You are used to managing a large, layered team.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You prefer working independently vs as part of an interdisciplinary team.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You love meetings! We’re a documentation first, async friendly team that values written communication as a core mode of communication.

            "descriptionPlain": "ABOUT ASHBY\n\n - We’re building the next generation of enterprise software, starting with products that help talent leaders, recruiters, and managers unlock hiring excellence\n\n - Raised our Series D earlier this year, and we’re growing ARR >100% YoY\n\n - Have over 3,000 amazing customers including OpenAI, Ramp, Deliveroo, Notion and Reddit\n\n - Built multiple products to win both land-and-expand and material new business deals\n\n - Rapidly moving up-market with no signs of slowing down\n\n - Implemented AI https://www.ashbyhq.com/blog/recruiting/ai-assisted-application-review-in-practice throughout the platform\n\n - Known for our pace of innovation and advanced analytics\n\n\nABOUT THIS ROLE\n\nAs the Head of Revenue Enablement, you will be the business partner to our VP Sales and VP Customer Success to ensure consistently high caliber execution to support revenue growth and customer retention. You will play a pivotal role in developing and, with your team, executing programs that foster excellence in our Sales and CS organizations. Success in this hands-on leadership role is measured by the overall effectiveness of our customer-facing Sales & CS teams — this includes but isn’t limited to: fast time-to-ramp for new hires, consistent adoption of our frameworks and methodologies, strategic business partnership with GTM leadership and ultimately delightful customer experiences that drive growth.\n\nIn 2026, Revenue Enablement will be a team of three. You will lead and manage two practitioners, one for each Sales and Customer Success. You will operate in a player-coach capacity, with an eagerness to roll up your sleeves to support program delivery and ensure execution against company priorities. Sales & CS will be close to 200 people by the end of next year, and so you and your team will have a high impact role on Ashby’s growth trajectory to $100M ARR and well beyond.\n\n\nROLE SCOPE & REQUIREMENTS\n\n - 🤝 Business Partnership: You are innately curious about the work and priorities of our Sales and CS Leaders. You ask the hard questions to understand the nuances of the business to identify how you can have the greatest impact. You partner effectively with stakeholders including Product Marketing, Revenue Operations and Senior Leadership to deliver comprehensive programs in support of our go-to-market strategy.\n\n - ⚙️ Program Development & Iteration: You understand business needs and identify gaps in knowledge or skills. You’re a quick learner who is at home creating and curating materials for go-to-market teams. You collect disparate information through quantitative and qualitative approaches (e.g. interviews, internal documentation, and recorded customer calls) to create tailored learning paths that drive behavior change. You have a track record of proactively eliciting feedback for program improvement and use that, along with performance data and business outcomes, to iterate, refine and scale programs that deliver measurable impact.\n\n - 🧑‍🏫 New Hire Onboarding: You have experience developing onboarding programs for GTM teams that ensure new hires ramp quickly. You have a knack for simplification and prioritization—sometimes less is more. You can be the master architect for role and segment specific onboarding tracks.\n\n - 💻 Systems: You’ve managed an LMS and have perspective on which software capabilities best support learning outcomes and in-field execution. You closely follow AI-native enablement vendors and can separate marketing fluff from powerful new features.\n\n - 🚀 Scaling: You’ve helped a SaaS company scale to over $100M ARR where you lead an enablement team. You thrive in a high growth, dynamic environment and are familiar with reinforcement learning techniques to support organizations of this scale.\n\n - 📈 Impact: You use both analytics and observations to assess the impact of your enablement programs. You have a proven track record of achieving measurable improvements in team performance and productivity. You iterate on your approach based on results, evolving company goals, and changing market conditions.\n\n - 👷 Team Management: You are highly organized and have managed a small but mighty enablement team who deliver multiple projects concurrently. You’re an “in the details” leader who ensures the success of your team’s work. You know when to advocate for additional resources to maximize impact.\n\n\nOUT OF SCOPE\n\nSince every organization thinks about Revenue Enablement a little bit differently, we intend to be clear about what we currently view as out of scope for this role, while also acknowledging that things may evolve, and your perspective also counts.\n\n - Technical Enablement / Ashby Product: We have an expansive product surface area as a full-suite talent acquisition platform. Our Support, CS and Solutions Engineering teams especially need to develop deep product acumen to be effective in their jobs. We anticipate you being a partner to other owners of Technical Enablement but it is not your primary responsibility.\n\n - Competitive Intelligence: You would not be expected to become the subject matter expert on our competitive landscape, but would partner with our PMM and Solutions Engineering teams on the creation of competitive enablement programs, leveraging existing knowledge and frameworks.\n\n\nYOU MIGHT LOVE THIS ROLE IF\n\n - You have a desire to build a world-class GTM practice.\n\n - You’re a systems thinker with experience scaling enablement programs.\n\n - Your peers would describe you as operationally excellent.\n\n - You excel in cross-functional collaboration.\n\n - You have strong opinions on hiring and org design for Enablement\n\n\nTHIS ROLE MIGHT NOT BE FOR YOU IF\n\n - You are uncomfortable rolling up your sleeves and executing. You will be extremely hands-on in this role, this is not a role for delegators.\n\n - You are used to managing a large, layered team.\n\n - You prefer working independently vs as part of an interdisciplinary team.\n\n - You love meetings! We’re a documentation first, async friendly team that values written communication as a core mode of communication. (We’re not anti-meeting but highly value the written word).\n\n\nOUR PHILOSOPHY\n\nHere are a few points relevant to go-to-market that should give you an idea of what it is like to work with us:\n\n - We believe a highly differentiated product is a lot easier to sell, so we continually invest in product innovation and this has proven to be a sustainable source of competitive differentiation\n\n - We always aim to show up well prepared and with deep industry acumen. This caliber of customer experience is another way we differentiate.\n\n - We strongly believe that small teams with very talented people (and the right work environment) deliver much better performance than teams with large headcount. We hire and compensate accordingly.\n\nWe value a strong sense of ownership, principled thinking over experience, and thoughtful communication (we put a lot of effort into using the right communication channels) - we’ll get into these and other values during the hiring process.\n\n\nBENEFITS\n\n - You’ll get the time to do things the right way; we put a lot of emphasis on high quality work and avoid quick hacks, but equally move with precision and urgency\n\n - Competitive compensation, including equity\n\n - 10-year exercise window for stock options. You shouldn’t feel pressure to purchase stock options if you leave Ashby —do it when you feel financially comfortable.\n\n - Unlimited PTO with four weeks is recommended per year.\n\n - Twelve weeks of fully paid family leave in the US. We plan to expand this to employees in other countries as situations arise.\n\n - Generous equipment, software, and office furniture budget. Get what you need to be happy and productive!\n\n - $100/month education budget with more expensive items (like conferences) covered with manager approval.\n\nAshby provides equal employment opportunities (EEO) to all employees and applicants for employment without regard to race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability, genetics, sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression. We are committed to a diverse and inclusive workforce and welcome people from all backgrounds, experiences, perspectives, and abilities.",

At the same time, you're a lifelong learner and are open to new ideas and experimentation.\n\n - 🤝 You are comfortable jumping into deals to establish executive relationships with customers. You do so without ‘boxing out’ your team.\n\n - ⚙️ You have an operational mindset and have identified bottlenecks and implemented solutions to accelerate deal flow.
